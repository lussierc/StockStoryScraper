Apple Cuts the Little Guys a Break. Will It Be Enough?,Motley Fool,2 weeks ago,2020-11-19 20:26:12.224813,"Last week, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled a new program that was clearly designed to address the ongoing antitrust criticisms that it is receiving. Dubbed the ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/21/apple-cuts-the-little-guys-a-break-will-it-be-enou/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Last week, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled a new program that was clearly designed to address the ongoing antitrust criticisms that it is receiving. Dubbed the App Store Small Business Program, qualifying developers that earn $1 million in annual revenue or less can enjoy a commission rate of just 15%, or half of the normal 30% cut that the Mac maker takes on digital sales.

Is the move too little, too late?

How the program works

Apple has faced backlash for its standard 30% cut, particularly in the context of small, independent developers that don't make as much money as the richest company on Earth. As long as the developer generated $1 million or less in gross proceeds in the previous calendar year, the developer is eligible for the reduced rate.

The program goes into effect on Jan. 1 of next year, so a developer's 2020 proceeds will determine eligibility for next year. The Cupertino tech juggernaut will use a developer's earnings after deducting Apple's cut to determine the developer's proceeds. As soon as a developer hits $1 million in proceeds, the normal 30% cut will apply ""for the remainder of the year.""

The company says that the new program will help ""the vast majority"" of developers on the App Store, without elaborating or providing specific metrics. Mobile analytics specialist Sensor Tower estimates that the change will affect 98% of developers on the platform, according to The New York Times. However, those small developers represent less than 5% of App Store revenue, so Apple isn't really giving up all that much in terms of absolute dollars.

Playing more defense

The company has spent much of 2020 defending itself from allegations of anticompetitive behavior. Apple backed a study earlier this year that showed that its 30% commission is comparable to other digital platforms such as gaming consoles.

Last month, the House Judiciary Committee released findings following a 16-month investigation. Lawmakers argued that the App Store represents a monopoly on iOS software distribution, and Apple pushed back aggressively on the findings, preferring to define the relevant market as broadly as possible to minimize its market share.

Apple has been making a series of small concessions in an effort to alleviate concerns, such as recently allowing users to change the default apps for certain functions on iOS. The new program is yet another incremental concession intended for the same purpose, but it might not be enough to quell criticisms. In fact, Apple's most vocal critics -- including Spotify and Fortnite maker Epic Games -- are already railing against the change, arguing that the $1 million threshold is arbitrary and creates a new tiered system that developers must now navigate.

It's great that Apple is giving indie devs a better deal, but 95% of in-app purchases are in bigger apps that Apple still taxes at 30%, so this will provide no relief to consumers who are paying inflated prices for items. — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) November 18, 2020

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney pointed out that Apple's higher 30% cut will still apply to most in-app purchases, which theoretically leads to higher prices. That's important because lawmakers and regulators often focus on the ultimate impact on consumers when evaluating allegations of anticompetitive behavior.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.268, 'neu': 0.732, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.2023}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.10115,-0.148,0.10115,0.018100000000000005,Neutral,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Negative,Somewhat Positive
Forget Apple. These 5 Stocks Are a Better Bet on New Digital Data Privacy Standards,Motley Fool,2 weeks ago,2020-11-19 20:26:12.227196,"Apple is upending the ad tracking industry. Disruption opens the door for new leaders to take advantage. Nicholas Rossolillo. (TMFnrossolillo). Nov 20, 2020 at ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/20/forget-apple-stocks-better-on-digital-data-privacy/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","During its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) management announced a major change was coming: Device users will be prompted to opt into Identity for Advertisers (IDFA) when opening an application. The change is to go into effect in early 2021, buying app developers and advertisers time to adjust -- but the change nonetheless upends a primary (and controversial) way businesses monetize their wares and advertisers track the efficacy of their marketing. Alphabet is expected to follow suit and implement similar changes to its Android mobile operating system.

However, this doesn't mean digital ad tracking is dead. Apple will allow for the collection of data, although device- and user-specific data won't be revealed. The coming changes will also alter behavior at technology firms and alter the way digital content gets monetized.

This could open the door to growth for those players developing viable alternatives to personal data collection and tracking. Five companies doing just that might be worth a look. They are: Magnite (NASDAQ:MGNI), LiveRamp Holdings (NYSE:RAMP), The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). Here's why these stocks are a better bet for dealing with new digital data privacy standards.

1. Magnite and 2. LiveRamp: Building new platforms based on publishers, not users

Magnite and LiveRamp are at the forefront of changes to targeted advertising. Both platforms help publishers and advertisers transition away from individual activity tracking to a model that uses an anonymous collection of data. Let's start with Magnite, a supply-side platform (SSP) that is helping publishers scale up their marketing activity using information they themselves are collecting directly from customers.

Magnite CEO Michael Barrett explained that the existing individual identity model is shifting to one powered by publishers themselves, and Magnite is positioned as one of the only SSPs with broad-based publisher relationships and the tools to help them implement more data-friendly practices. In fact, Barrett said on the company's Q3 2020 earnings call that more than 10% of the revenue it generated for publishers was derived from whole audience segments created on Magnite's platform directly, compared to almost none a year ago. The company thinks its sell-side data technology revenue will double again by the end of 2021.

However, as Magnite itself has pointed out, first-party consented targeting (in which the user opts in to tracking) will continue to play a part in this new advertising landscape. That's where LiveRamp comes in. LiveRamp pools first-party anonymized data collected from consumer-facing businesses. The result is a collection of robust consumer data that product and content creators and advertisers can access to make better decisions. Both Magnite and LiveRamp struggled early in the pandemic, as many ad campaigns were temporarily put on hold, but they have since rebounded and continue to forecast double-digit percentage growth through the end of 2020.

3. The Trade Desk: The leading buy-side platform embraces anonymity too

While a sell-side platform helps publishers monetize content, the buy-side of the equation helps those companies looking to market their goods and services find the right outlets (webpages, podcasts, TV spots, etc.) to reach their audience. That's the role that The Trade Desk plays, and its cloud-based platform to help marketers automate and target ideal customers has soared over the last few years.

Besides enjoying general industry migration to digital channels and programmatic targeted ads, The Trade Desk could also benefit from the switch away from identity tracking. The company recently announced a partnership with LiveRamp in which marketers can now bid and transact on LiveRamp's anonymous data-driven platform directly on The Trade Desk. The result is campaign personalization and performance tracking without the need for individual device or app activity tracking.

In the years ahead, adding a new level of user privacy, transparency, and control to its cloud-based marketing tech could help The Trade Desk maintain its fast upward trajectory.

4. Salesforce and 5. Adobe: Helping organizations unlock the power of their data

Software juggernauts Salesforce and Adobe have approached digital transformation from different directions -- the former from its customer relationship management (CRM) software core proficiency, and the latter from its creative software for content and media producers. But both are finding success helping their customers unlock and make full use of their own internal data.

And in a world where privacy and user consent is rightfully getting more attention, unlocking insights on relationships organizations already have with paying customers will only increase in importance. And Salesforce and Adobe are helping in this regard. While their CRM and content creation competencies remain the primary drivers of growth, both have added buy-side marketing to their cloud-based software suites. It's been a valuable add-on for both of them. Organizations are deploying their data within the respective platforms to drive better go-to-market and sales strategies, and use of Salesforce's and Adobe's marketing tools could get a big boost if other device makers follow Apple's lead in eliminating non-consented user tracking.

Apple's first move in removing IDFA won't be the end of the digital data privacy revolution. More changes lie ahead as consumers demand more control over their personal information and activity -- and who's able to utilize it. But in the next stage of transformation, these five companies could benefit from enabling marketers to comply with the coming user-friendlier adjustments.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.655, 'neu': 0.345, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2263}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.4404}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.2, 'neu': 0.64, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': -0.128}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.2, 'neu': 0.64, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': -0.128}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",-0.0256,0.10705,-0.0256,0.01861666666666667,Neutral,Neutral,Somewhat Positive,Neutral
"Warren Buffett Is Throwing Billions at This Stock. Should You Buy, Too?",Motley Fool,2 weeks ago,2020-11-19 20:26:12.228737,The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Berkshire Hathaway (B shares) and recommends the following options: long January 2021 $200 ...,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/21/warren-buffett-is-throwing-billions-at-this-stock/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)(NYSE:BRK-A) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett knows a thing or two about investing, to put it mildly. His investment prowess has helped Berkshire stock grow at an average rate of 20% annually between 1965 and 2019, or a total of 2,744,062%. This obliterated the S&P 500 index's return over the same time frame. The popular index rose 19,784% (including reinvested dividends) over this period.

With such a stellar track record, it's worth checking what the Oracle of Omaha's conglomerate is buying the most. Fortunately, Buffett's top stock pick for 2020 is easy to spot, as there's one company's shares he's spending far more money on than anything else: Berkshire Hathaway itself. The company is repurchasing its own shares in droves, signaling to investors that Buffett thinks Berkshire stock is undervalued.

Buffett just bought $9 billion more of this stock

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission released earlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway revealed it bought an incredible $9 billion of its own stock during Q3 -- more than the company has ever spent buying back the stock in any single year.

Buffett's move to spend billions buying back Berkshire shares extends the famed investor's growing bullishness on the stock. The company has been steadily increasing its buybacks recently. In the first and second quarter of 2020, Berkshire repurchases amounted to $1.7 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.

For context on just how aggressive Buffett's recent repurchases of Berkshire stock are, note that the company spent only $4.9 billion repurchasing shares in 2019. Even more, Berkshire is now spending more money buying back its own stock than any other publicly traded company, barring Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Of course, the tech company has a market capitalization four times the size of Berkshire and is raking in $73 billion of free cash annually, so it's pretty easy for the iPhone maker to spend more than Berkshire.

Should you buy, too?

When Buffett is buying back Berkshire stock aggressively, it means he thinks shares are undervalued relative to their long-term prospects. Unlike some companies that implement a share repurchase program without considering what the stock price is trading at the time, Buffett and his investment partner Charlie Munger only buy back the stock when they think they're getting a good deal.

""If the price-to-value discount (as we estimate it) widens, we will likely become more aggressive in purchasing shares,"" Buffett said in Berkshire's most recent annual letter to shareholders. ""We will not, however, prop the stock at any level.""

Buffett emphasized in the same shareholder letter that he is not interested in buying back the stock at a slight discount. The price needs to be meaningfully undervalued before Berkshire acts. ""Calculations of intrinsic value are far from precise,"" the CEO explained. ""Consequently, neither [Charlie or myself feel] any urgency to buy an estimated $1 of value for a very real 95 cents.""

With Buffett buying record amounts of Berkshire stock, he's likely exceptionally bullish on the company's shares right now.

Of course, investors shouldn't buy Berkshire stock only because Buffett is an aggressive buyer; they should take the time to do their own due diligence. Still, Buffett seems to be onto something. Based on the stock's conservative valuation of 20 times free cash flow and the quality of the company's underlying assets -- from its $113 billion stake in Apple to its massive insurance business -- Berkshire stock does look like a great investment opportunity for investors willing hold shares for the long haul.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.631, 'pos': 0.272, 'compound': 0.5106}]","[{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.631, 'pos': 0.272, 'compound': 0.5106}]",0.5106,0.0,0.5106,0.34040000000000004,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive

Only a few years ago, the software giant was facing an uncertain future. Its formerly dominant operating system business was steadily losing relevance as modern computing moved away from the PC and into mobile, an area the company had never established a foothold in.

Fast forward to today, and Microsoft is back in the game. It's grown its market value to more than $1.6 trillion at recent prices.

On the Nov. 2 edition of ""The Wrap"" on Motley Fool Live, Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers walked ""The Wrap"" host Jason Hall and Motley Fool contributor Brian Feroldi through Microsoft's latest results, pointing out just how well the company is executing.

Tim Beyers: Right. Microsoft had its first quarter earnings report and this was last week. Let me just pull this up here because I want to pull up their release. But I think it was very strong and I think the thing that it gets glossed over, but it shouldn't, is that among the ones that are here domestically in the U.S. That's talking AWS, Microsoft Azure, and I don't know. Some people say Azure, I say Azure. I don't know. Abiomed.

Tim Beyers: BioMed, I have no idea. But here's a thing, of the three, Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS, who is the fastest-growing? Who continues to be the fastest-growing? Azure and they did it again. Let me just show this here.

Jason Hall: Wait. You mean Azure?

Tim Beyers: Yeah. There you go. Exactly right.

Brian Feroldi: Azure.

Tim Beyers: Yes or whatever. Do we even know? I don't know. So overall, Microsoft Azure was up 45% year-over-year. But here's the thing I want to show just in general. If you take a look across all the products, remember that this is a company that's well over a trillion dollars in market cap. This is growing very quickly. I just want to show some basic products and how fast these are growing. Server products up 21% in constant currency. Xbox content and services up 30% same year-over-year. Microsoft Surface, their hardware product in constant currency up 36% year-over-year.

Windows is -- granted -- you want to talk Windows and Windows OEM, installing Window machines that ship from somebody else, like Microsoft has a deal with say like Dell, and then Dell puts Windows on their machines and then they ship out those machines. So Microsoft gets some licensing fees. That used to be the biggest part of their business, down 5% year-over-year. That is largely, except for Bing, search advertising, everything else, except Office commercial products is double-digit growth. That is astounding.

Let me give you some perspective on this. So overall, in the latest quarter, Apple, killer business. We all know Apple is a great business. But Apple's big growth opportunity, is services. How much do you guys think services was up for Apple in the most recent quarter?

Brian Feroldi: 5%.

Tim Beyers: About 16%. It's definitely growth. Look at all these products. That's like basically matching LinkedIn, which Microsoft's like, ""Yeah. We got this thing."" My point here is that, Microsoft is really killing it. They're really killing it and I think that is underappreciated about how this company has structured a portfolio of products that has been very attractive for the customer base that's very sticky and they have this two layers. They have the Office products and the Windows products that provide an annuity cash flow stream, that Microsoft has proven really adept at reinvesting into high-growth opportunities, like Azure and they're killing it. I continue to believe that even though I say of the two, between Amazon and Microsoft, because if you split up Amazon today, and you split out AWS, I think Amazon would be a more valuable company. But in terms of business quality, I do not believe there is a better business in the world right now than Microsoft. Full stop.

Those faster speeds could spur fresh sales of network hardware, faster phones, and innovative new devices and services across the Internet of Things.

Earlier this month, I highlighted a few 5G stocks that will reward patient investors with decent dividends. Today, I want to take a closer look at three 5G stocks that are also cheap relative to their growth potential: China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Let's take a closer look at these tech stocks.

1. China Mobile

China Mobile, the Middle Kingdom's top telecom company, provided services for 946.2 million wireless subscribers in September, up 0.4% from a year ago. Its number of 4G customers rose 3% to 769.5 million, as its 5G customer base -- which didn't exist a year ago -- hit 113.6 million.

In the first nine months of 2020, China Mobile's operating revenue rose 1.4% year over year, but its profit dipped 0.3% due to higher 5G infrastructure costs. For the full year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 7% and 6%, respectively, as it locks in higher-value 5G subscribers in the fourth quarter.

China Mobile is often considered a safe stock for three simple reasons: It's the market leader, it's a state-owned enterprise, and it pays a decent semi-annual dividend, which usually stays between 3%-5% based on its annual profit.

However, China Mobile's stock tumbled 30% this year as U.S. regulators repeatedly threatened to delist U.S.-listed Chinese stocks over their alleged ties to the Chinese government. The Trump administration's latest executive order, which goes into effect on Jan. 11, could bar American investors from buying shares of China Mobile and 30 other companies.

As a result, China Mobile trades at just eight times forward earnings. That discount might be justified, but investors should recall President Donald Trump's previous executive orders against TikTok and WeChat flopped, and the Biden administration could quickly overturn the order. Therefore, China Mobile's stock could rebound quickly if those regulatory headwinds dissipate.

2. Ericsson

Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson controlled 14% of the world's telecom equipment market last year, according to Dell'Oro Group. It ranked third behind Huawei's 27% share and Nokia's (NYSE:NOK) 16% share.

But Ericsson is growing faster than Nokia, and it doesn't face trade blacklists and sanctions like Huawei. Ericsson also shrewdly navigated the U.S.-China trade war by retaining its 5G contracts in China, even after Nokia lost several large customers (including China Mobile) while gaining new 5G contracts from other customers that had cut ties with Huawei.

As of this writing, Ericsson has secured 117 commercial 5G agreements globally. Analysts expect Ericsson's growing presence in the 5G market, along with stable sales of its other networking devices and services, to lift its revenue and earnings 7% and 26%, respectively, next year.

Ericsson's stock has already rallied nearly 40% this year on rosy expectations for its 5G business, but its stock still looks cheap at 17 times forward earnings. Ericsson also pays a decent forward yield of 1.4%. Like China Mobile, it pays a semi-annual dividend, which is tied to its profit growth.

3. Broadcom

Broadcom sells a wide range of wireless chips for the data center, networking hardware, storage solutions, broadband, wireless, and industrial markets. It also provides infrastructure software and security services.

Broadcom generated a fifth of its revenue from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) last year. It also signed a new $15 billion contract with Apple at the beginning of 2020 to provide wireless chips to the iPhone maker for the next three and a half years. That tight relationship indicates robust sales of the iPhone 12 will likely boost Broadcom's sales over the next few quarters.

The pandemic disrupted Broadcom's sales of networking and broadband chips earlier this year. But it offset that slowdown with the growth of its software business, and its chip sales stabilized over the past two quarters as cloud and telecom customers resumed their infrastructure upgrades.

During last quarter's conference call in September, CEO Hock Tan predicted Broadcom would start ""benefiting from the transition to 5G and new product ramps later this year."" In other words, infrastructure customers should start buying more chips for their 5G networks, and 5G device makers will install more wireless chips in their products.

Wall Street expects Broadcom's revenue and earnings to rise 9% and 16%, respectively, as it rides those accelerating tailwinds next year. That's an impressive growth rate for a stock that trades at just 15 times forward earnings, and its quarterly dividend sports an impressive forward yield of 3.4%.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
Better Buy: QQQ vs. VOO,Motley Fool,2 weeks ago,2020-11-19 20:26:12.232974,"There is also substantial overlap in holdings, with the two funds sharing Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet among their top 10 largest positions.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/20/better-buy-qqq-vs-voo/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","The Invesco QQQ Trust and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF are both reputable and popular funds that track major market indexes. Many investors hold both funds and face decisions about how to allocate between the two.

There is some overlap between the two ETFs, but they ultimately have different characteristics and historical performance that would make each better suited for different roles in a portfolio. Which is the better buy depends entirely on what an investor is hoping to accomplish.

These ETFs are reputable and similar in several ways

QQQ and VOO are both high-quality funds, and they are similar in many ways. Both have over $100 billion in assets under management, and both have relatively low expense ratios. There is also substantial overlap in holdings, with the two funds sharing Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet among their top 10 largest positions. QQQ and VOO are both highly liquid, with 0.01% average spreads high daily trading volumes.

ETF Assets Under Management Expense Ratio Distribution Yield P/E Ratio Price-to-Book Ratio Average Daily Volume Invesco QQQ Trust NASDAQ:QQQ) $137 billion 0.2% 0.57% 39.6 8.2 $12.1 billion Vanguard S&P 500 ETF NYSEMKT:VOO) $172 billion 0.03% 1.65% 33.9 3.8 $938 million

Allocation has led to differing performances

The key differences between the two funds are concentration and diversification, which has caused performance to diverge over the years. QQQ tracks the non-financial stocks that make up the NASDAQ-100 Index, whereas VOO is meant to track the S&P 500.

As a result, QQQ is much more heavily exposed to the tech sector and large-cap growth stocks. More than one-third of VOO's assets are allocated to the tech sector; QQQ nearly doubles that. VOO has approximately five times as many holdings, the top five of which comprise less than 20% of the total portfolio. QQQ's top three holdings make up 35% of the total allocation, and the top five are almost 45%.

A high concentration in tech and growth stocks leads to more volatility and higher upside. Since QQQ's inception in 2010, the fund has returned 536% through a historic, sustained bull market, compared to VOO's 228%. Through a volatile, yet positive, 2020 to date, QQQ has also outpaced Vanguard's flagship S&P ETF by 25 percentage points on the back of its biggest tech holdings.

However, the NASDAQ is prone to larger drawdowns during turbulent markets. Since the market's charge abated in September, VOO has gained 2.4% while QQQ has dropped 2.6%. Even with this recent divergence, the NASDAQ still has richer valuation ratios. That's hardly unexpected or bad, but it can further exacerbate volatility.

So which is a better buy?

Unfortunately, there is some nuance to this answer. Equity ownership is generally meant to provide capital growth in a portfolio, and QQQ has built a resume as the better option for long-term returns. However, the fund's volatility and portfolio concentration make it inappropriate for many investors. Anyone with a low risk tolerance, shorter time horizon, or preference for income investments should prefer VOO. Investors who are not in a position to withstand a downward fluctuation need to think about the pitfalls of low diversification and growth stock investing.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.58, 'pos': 0.42, 'compound': 0.4404}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.712, 'pos': 0.288, 'compound': 0.7269}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.712, 'pos': 0.288, 'compound': 0.7269}]",0.7269,0.4404,0.7269,0.6314000000000001,Positive,Very Positive,Positive,Very Positive
How Etsy Can Fuel More High Growth,Motley Fool,2 weeks ago,2020-11-19 20:26:12.234318,The appeal of discovering items across all these categories should go a long way toward bringing in more buyers. John Ballard owns shares of Apple. The Motley ...,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/20/how-etsy-can-fuel-more-high-growth/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) has been winning big in 2020 with new buyers, which contributed to strong revenue performance in the third quarter. Revenue more than doubled year over year, while new buyers made up a quarter of its gross merchandise sales.

While investors might be concerned about how a COVID-19 vaccine could slow down Etsy's momentum if more people feel comfortable shopping in stores again, Etsy still has opportunities to drive further growth.

More people are discovering Etsy

One of management's top priorities has been to convince lapsed buyers that Etsy can be a go-to place to shop for a range of items for many occasions.

The pandemic gave Etsy some momentum in this effort. Etsy added 10 million new buyers and 5 million reactivated buyers over the last 12 months through the third quarter. A reactivated buyer is someone who hasn't bought anything on the platform in the last 12 months. Overall, the number of active buyers grew by 56% year over year, reaching 69 million, representing roughly half of all unique buyers who have ever bought anything on Etsy.

People obviously like shopping on Etsy. It's a unique marketplace where people can find vintage and other one-of-a-kind items. That's Etsy's pitch, but on one hand, this niche position that Etsy occupies in e-commerce might present a challenge in getting older buyers to come back. It might be that items on Etsy are so special that many buyers may only think to shop there for gift-giving purposes, which may only come once a year.

On the other hand, Etsy is gaining momentum and could be reaching a tipping point in its growth curve. Consider that there are still approximately 70 million people who have shopped on Etsy before, but not in the last 12 months. That spells a massive opportunity.

What's more, there are still millions of people who have yet to discover Etsy. It's clear that CEO Josh Silverman sees this year as a potential turning point for Etsy's growth. During the call, he said: ""I think we're broadening our appeal to more and more types of people and more and more demographics, and we love it.""

Etsy is still improving

Management outlined some of the ways it's working to keep current buyers engaged and bring back lapsed buyers.

First, Etsy just launched a personalized search feature. With this new functionality, Etsy takes users' clicks, favorite items, and items they have added to their shopping carts and delivers a unique search result for each keyword. Now, two people who enter the same keyword will get different results. This should make the search and discovery experience on the marketplace much easier and more fun for buyers, which could keep them coming back.

Etsy is also launching a new Gift Like You Mean It advertising campaign for the holidays, which will seek to build an emotional connection with the brand by telling a story. The new ads are reminiscent of the incredibly effective advertising that Apple has done over the years and could be very effective in driving higher sales on the platform.

Along with marketing investments, Etsy is investing heavily in its engineering team. The headcount increased 14% year over year in the third quarter, but Etsy is still catching up with its growth and scale. Part of the increase in talent is to assist with improving buyer frequency on the marketplace. It's worth noting that Etsy's average revenue per employee has nearly tripled to $1.1 million since fiscal 2016, which shows that the business should only get more productive the more it grows and brings in more talent.

Etsy still has a long way to go

It's reasonable to assume that Etsy will see its revenue growth moderate from recent triple-digit levels once vaccines for COVID-19 are available and people feel more comfortable returning to in-store shopping. But Etsy still grew revenue by 35% in 2019.

Still, we can't discount Etsy's niche in e-commerce and its ability to continue driving robust growth by bringing back lapsed buyers. The improvements it's making to search and marketing, and other behind-the-scenes tweaks to the shopping experience, show a business that is still far away from its potential.

It's a great sign that Etsy has been seeing strong growth across major retail categories, such as apparel and personal care products. The appeal of discovering items across all these categories should go a long way toward bringing in more buyers.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.676, 'pos': 0.324, 'compound': 0.4364}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.694, 'pos': 0.306, 'compound': 0.296}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.694, 'pos': 0.306, 'compound': 0.296}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.09866666666666667,0.4364,0.09866666666666667,0.21124444444444446,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Positive,Somewhat Positive
Will Retail REITs Struggle or Thrive in 2021?,Motley Fool,2 weeks ago,2020-11-19 20:26:12.235558,"Apple, 6.5%, so Apple is three times bigger than all the REITs in the S&P 500.

The industry was already in the midst of a transition due to the growth of e-commerce before a pandemic brutalized the economy, and proved the final nail in the coffin for many retailers. While the S&P 500 has bounced back and delivered 13% in total returns since the beginning of the year, on strong gains by the tech sector, the S&P 1500 Retail REITs Index is still down more than 30%.

But the question many investors want answered is this: Is the worst behind us, or will retail REITs continue to struggle? On the Nov. 2 edition of ""The Wrap"" on Motley Fool Live, host Jason Hall engaged Motley Fool contributor Brian Feroldi and Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers to answer this exact question. And while all three think the worst is, broadly speaking, probably over, they have some differences in their expectations going forward.

Transcript:

Jason Hall: Pennsylvania Real Estate Trust (NYSE:PEI). I have to confess, this is one that I bought some of before, this was back in January or February. This is the largest mall owner in Philadelphia. It just filed for bankruptcy. Brian Feroldi, I'm going to get you to go first here. I want you to tell me, will retail REIT stocks, so these are the companies that own the property, will they finish 2021 higher or lower?

Brian Feroldi: Than they are right now, I assume.

Jason Hall: Than they are right now, and why.

Brian Feroldi: Higher, they're higher. They will finish higher because by the end of 2021, we will have a vaccine, good malls will attract back people, bad malls will die, as they should, or be converted into other usable space, but I think the devaluations are so compressed on these things. I'm going to pull it up while Tim's talking, but I'm pretty sure that REITs make up 2% of the S&P 500 right now, it's somewhere around there, two percent. Apple, 6.5%, so Apple is three times bigger than all the REITs in the S&P 500. I'm not saying that's wrong, but I think there's room for REITs to go higher from here, especially over the next year plus.

Jason Hall: Tim Beyers, what do you say?

Tim Beyers: I agree with that for a different reason. I'm just going to slightly modify what Brian said because he's right in that I believe it's a small portion of the market right now, and what you said about things being repurposed, I think that's the key. I don't think the malls come back in the same way, but I believe that there's so much movement in e-commerce and movement toward logistics and flexible workspace and things like that that there's a lot of repurposed property, these fixed malls [...] reimagined as distribution centers, as all sorts of stuff that I think we can creatively reengage that space, and I think we will.

So I expect it to be higher once we start reimagining. For example, I'll just say that I would find it fascinating but also not at all surprising if Amazon goes shopping in the mall space and starts figuring out like, we're going to have a distribution center here, here, here. They got a lot of cash, they have a lot of cash flow, I could absolutely see them doing that and maybe even just tying it close to where they have all those Kohl's. You go and you drop off your return at Kohl's, get that near an Amazon distribution center, you're just optimizing, optimizing, optimizing and, man, there's nobody better than Amazon at that. So I'm going to say higher for the repurposing.

Jason Hall: I agree. I think at this point the baby's been thrown out with the bathwater. I think the idea that the mall is going to completely go away is just as false as every piece of commercial real estate in Manhattan is going to be useless. I think that there's a lot of really extreme assumptions that are getting factored into a lot of things, so I tend to agree. I think, to both Tim and Brian's point, whether it's still serving the same purpose, that's definitely up for discussion. I think, in general, a lot of it is going to get repurposed.

I think the best companies out there that are owning large malls are in the best positions to negotiate with an Amazon. If you're Amazon, you want to talk to somebody that owns 300, 500 malls because then you can pick the 50 or 100 that best fit your need versus Pennsylvania Real Estate Trust that just owns malls in a very small geographically located area that don't give them access to the markets that they need. So it's going to be really interesting to see how it plays, but I tend to agree. I'll go so far as to say not only will they be higher, I think they're going to outperform the S&P 500 over the next two years, five years, maybe even the next 10 years. I think there's a lot of opportunity.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.247, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.1967}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.1967}]",0.09835,-0.3182,0.09835,-0.040499999999999994,Neutral,Somewhat Positive,Negative,Somewhat Positive
Ask A Digital Health CEO: How Has Coronavirus Changed The Wellness Industry?,Motley Fool,2 weeks ago,2020-11-19 20:26:12.236850,"... ago, you would probably pinch yourself that do I actually have access to this type of data that consumer products like Apple Watch or Amazon Halo has today?",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/21/ask-a-digital-health-ceo-how-has-coronavirus-chang/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","For many people, the coronavirus pandemic has changed their nutrition and exercise habits. One app helping people track their food and lose weight is called Lifesum. The company has scaled rapidly to 45 million users and boasts partnerships with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and GE (NYSE:NKE).

Fool.com's Healthcare and Cannabis Bureau Chief Corinne Cardina chatted with Lifesum's CEO Henrik Torstensson about the digital health and wellness space.

Corinne Cardina: Hello, Henrik, how are you?

Henrik Torstensson: Hi, I'm good. How are you?

Cardina: I'm so good. I am Corinne Cardina. I'm the Bureau Chief of Healthcare and Cannabis on fool.com. Fools, I've got with me today Henrik Torstensson, CEO of Lifesum, a digital health service. Henrik, did I say your name right?

Torstensson: It's Henrik, it's good.

Cardina: Great. We are going to talk about Lifesum today, but we're also going to talk about investing in the digital health space and what investors should know about the intersection of technology and wellness. I do want to let our viewers know that we're testing out a Q&A service called Slido. We use it at The Fool internally, we think you'll really like it. You can open up Slido in your browser or the app and the code is MFlive. You can submit questions, upvote other people's questions that you want to see us answer. Let's start out with learning about Lifesum. Henrik, could you give us a brief history of how you co-founded this company, what it is, what inspired you to start Lifesum and what stage of growth your company is in today?

Torstensson: Absolutely. Thank you for having me. We got started back in 2013. For us, digital health has been a couple of years and always exploding this year. What we do is that our mission is to improve lives through better eating. We help people eat better and manage their weight, and we have 45 million members. The U.S. is our biggest market, and we help people manage their weight and eat better by providing a digital service in apps for iPhone, Android phones, Amazon Halo, and other mass-market digital services.

Cardina: Great. We'll talk a little bit more about Amazon Halo later, a very exciting development there. But for our investors who are familiar with the digital health industry, I'd love to put Lifesum in context with some of the names that we are familiar with. There's traditional weight loss companies like Weight Watchers, and we like to give the takers when we're talking about public companies. I'm just going to put that in the chat. There's Weight Watchers, it used to be people would show up to the clinic. There was definitely an in-person social component. They've certainly pivoted more digitally in recent times, now it's called WW International (NASDAQ:WW). Then there are digital-first psychology based weight loss apps, and I think Lifesum falls more on this side of things. The one I'm familiar with was Noom. I'd love to hear what is unique about Lifesum and where does it fit in the digital health, and specifically the weight loss side of things?

Torstensson: What we've built is something that's popular both in Europe and the U.S., which is quite unique, 45 million members, and what we built is a service that allows our users to take a personalized approach to how they eat, so that might be that you want to eat a balanced diet, you want to have a high protein diet, you want to do intermittent fasting. We think that's really key to attract the millennial and Generation Z audiences where we do care No. 1, and so what we've done, we've built a service with great design, a brand that has built a lot of trust and destigmatized actually changing how you literally eat better and healthier. That's one of the things with millennials and Generation Z, it's not the weight watchers of 20 years ago, it's really about eating better, and the drivers of that are many.

Cardina: Yeah, that's so true. How has the health and wellness industry evolved over the last couple of decades, and more recently, how has the coronavirus pandemic impacted how people view their health and the role of technology?

Torstensson: Healthcare and wellness is obviously an enormous part of the economy. It's $2 trillion in the U.S. alone. It's probably maybe the biggest market we have. In digital, it's been ramping up, but it's been a fairly slow start because it's a complex system. You have individuals, you have insurance companies, you have state governments, federal governments that all have interests. It was picking up speed. This year with COVID and Corona, that really the same way we all ended up on Zoom for most of the year, and that really made having virtual meetings really a default way of operating. Healthcare is coming in the same way that it's really taking a step from, OK, this is happening a little bit at the edges, to becoming this central thrust of healthcare and the overall market.

Cardina: Yeah, great point. We've seen digital health disrupting a lot of historical industries like pharmaceuticals and health insurers. What do you think investors should know about traditional healthcare companies as they invest for the future?

Torstensson: I think investors should think that this is an enormous market, digital is really happening now, it's picking up speed, and it's growing quite fast, especially for such an important -- and for good reasons -- regulated industry. You have telemedicine, you have online pharmacies, you have across-the-board, really, digitalization coming both on the traditional aspects and doing things that couldn't be done before technology, that if you were a doctor 10-15 years ago, you would probably pinch yourself that do I actually have access to this type of data that consumer products like Apple Watch or Amazon Halo has today? If you look at other industries, media, commerce, they were far further along, obviously they also got a bump this year from COVID with the lockdowns, but it's the same thing happening to healthcare and wellness, and it's just an enormous industry. I think that's the big thing to think about.

Cardina: Absolutely. Do you think we're just starting to see how technology can disrupt the healthcare industry? Are we in the early stages?

Torstensson: I think we are in the early stages. Obviously, how technology is used within healthcare is probably still going to be regulated even if it feels disruptive, maybe for many participants. But it's also that the technology that was only available for hospitals 10-15 years ago in a reasonable user-friendly way is moving out to our phones and to our watches and blood oxygen levels, etc., that you're actually getting for very standard home electronics or smartphone devices.

Cardina: Yeah, absolutely. Your company has scaled incredibly fast; you said 45 million users. I think in the recent months, you guys saw 700,000 downloads. What is your guiding philosophy about leading a rapidly growing start-up?

Torstensson: It's really to start building a great product for users, because the thing that really drives any start-up in any companies is that you're serving customers; but with that as a focus, hire great people, trust them to do great work, and then find out great partners to really give an extra boost to the growth and reaching out to consumers.

Cardina: Yeah, definitely. Partnership has been a big strategy for Lifesum. The company has developed some really impressive partnerships with big tech companies, notably Amazon recently. Can you tell us more about Amazon Halo?

Torstensson: I'm very happy to be one of the nine launch partners for Amazon Halo, which is Amazon's new health device and program that is coming this fall. They're really interested in taking a very holistic approach to health and we are their nutrition partner on the lab side.

Cardina: Great. What does that mean? How does that work in practice?

Torstensson: With Amazon Halo, when you want to change your approach to nutrition and food, they have a part of the service called labs where we've made the content and the program that the subscribers and users of Amazon Halo are using to actually go on and change how they eat.

Cardina: Okay. It's an education component?

Torstensson: It's an interactive education component. You pick something you want to do and then there's this daily guidance to actually help you do that.

Cardina: Awesome. That's super exciting for you all. The Amazon Halo, it harnesses artificial intelligence to inform what we know about our bodies. What excites you about artificial intelligence in the healthcare space?

Torstensson: What I think is so fascinating and really promising is that there's this great amounts of data, and we collect hundreds of millions of data points every month from our 45 million users, and with artificial intelligence we are able to personalize the experience for individuals and actually dig out what we will learn from others to actually make it easier for everyone to live healthier lives.

Cardina: Great.

Torstensson: Get sick or get really on the preventive side, which is probably the best thing if you get it right.

Cardina: Yeah, absolutely. What might you say to folks who are skeptical that tech companies will protect their most private data, their biometrics, their health information?

Torstensson: I can only speak for Lifesum and we always start with users' rights and privacy. We collect the data that the user gives us to actually provide a service, and if they want us to share that with other services to make their lives better, we think that's fine, but it's not for us to go and share that data without user consent.

Cardina: Great, very important. I enjoyed looking around that Lifesum social media. It looks like social media is an important component of your strategy, really educating folks on some timely wellness trends, education. I saw an explainer on intermittent fasting, which is something I've been really interested in recently as well. What do you think about social media and the role it's playing in Lifesum's success?

Torstensson: To us, it's a digital service, and as eight years old, as a digital-native company with the millennial generation, it's obviously a core part of what we do and how we interact with our membership. It's important, but there are our partnerships as we discussed before. So it's really the mix of finding a great product, great social media, great partnerships, to make the magic source.

Cardina: Absolutely. How do you envision the future of digital health? What trends do you think will continue to gain momentum once the coronavirus pandemic subsides?

Torstensson: I think one thing that I'm really excited about, what we're doing is actually one of the AI-driven products, it's predictive tracking. By looking at everyone else that's used Lifesum and what you have done before as an individual user, we can actually predict what you're going to eat and that really creates this magical fluent experience. That level of being a daily part of a user's life is really exciting. I think that one segment of digital health that really got this pushed, which I think will stay with us and continue to grow is really telemedicine. I think that's going to stay with us because it's just more convenient for a lot of interactions with our doctors.

Cardina: Yeah, absolutely. Lifesum is all about eating, right? Eating is a big part of our lives. When you're ready to make a big change in your life for your health, food has a really big part of that. How does Lifesum help users change their way of living for the better as it pertains to food, nutrition, and eating?

Torstensson: We're all about food and nutrition and what we're saying is we want to improve lives through better eating; nutrition is the numbers aspect, but it's really about emotions and actually how we were brought up, our culture that impacts what and how we eat. What we do is we help users and we say it's really about the user. It's about being personalized, which way actually works for each individual. It might be intermittent fasting that you're interested in, that is something that you want to go down that road. Then we bring in the best knowledge, build a great experience, actually make that really, really easy.

Cardina: Excellent. What does the interface of Lifesum look like? Is it planned menus? Is it for people to track what they're eating and look at calories and the macro breakdown? I'd love to just hear about it from a user perspective.

Torstensson: It's a mix of that. We have a food tracker and you can search, you can use our barcode scanners or our image recognition to actually take a photo of what you're eating to pick that up, and then we'll give you individual feedback on that. That feedback differs depending on what your goal is, if you're trying to lose some weight or if you're trying to eat healthier or if you're trying to build muscle or gain weight, depending on if you're on intermittent fasting or high-protein or a balanced diet, actually what you want is very different feedback and that's what we built with our food rating algorithms. Then we also have recipes. We have plans that tell someone gets going. What we know is that if we look at 30 days of using Lifesum, you really moved. Even if you start out with very little understanding of nutrition and food and how what you eat impacts your health, after 30 days, you have taken an enormous step in understanding that.

Cardina: Yeah. I love looking at the data on all of my different wellness apps. When I go for a run, I love to see, did I go a little bit longer, a little bit faster than the last time? I think that touch point probably makes the product really sticky so your users continue to use the app for a long period of time. They don't just forget about it and move on. Is that right?

Torstensson: Yeah, absolutely. We have very loyal users. Sometimes people use it for a while. They use it to understand. We're nutrition partners of Nike, and as an example, really, if you're going to run a marathon or longer race, understanding what you eat and how you eat and how that impacts your performance is really critical.

Cardina: Yeah, absolutely. Are there any other partnerships beyond Amazon Halo that Lifesum has created that you'd like to talk about?

Torstensson: We're very proud and happy of being the nutrition partner of Nike, which we've been now for a little bit more than a year and obviously, an iconic company, then we are very happy with more of maybe relationships and partnerships with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and where we were part of the presentation on the WWDC Developers Conference this summer with our new widget which is part of the latest iOS.

Cardina: Awesome. We did get a question in from Andy pertaining to how the app works. What is the technology used to build menus for participants and the database of foods? It sounds really cool. You take a picture of food and the app recognizes what it is. How does that work technologically?

Torstensson: When you take a picture, then you're using actually artificial intelligence to do image recognition, and there are a few different ones depending on the platform, what you use; then, on menus, etc. that you find in the app, we have our in-house staff of nutritionists and a chef that helps us build that out so it's both healthy and delicious.

Cardina: Awesome. We have a user named Jayful who said, ""I haven't heard of Lifesum. How do people first find you?"" You said it's available on iOS.

Torstensson: iPhone and Android, you just go to the App Store and search for Lifesum and download us. Most people hear about us through word-of-mouth. For the U.S. market, we just got started four years ago and we've been operating for eight, but it's already our biggest market, so we're still in a growth phase in the U.S.

Cardina: Awesome. I'd like to talk a little bit more about the U.S. market in digital health. On Fool.com, we're investors, so we love to look at some of the public companies and the digital health companies, particularly in telehealth, that's been a big buzzword this year, we have been on a pretty wild ride since the pandemic began. The telehealth pioneer, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC), is at more than 200% since the start of March, reflecting its record setting number of telehealth visits. There's Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV), which sells cloud software for life sciences companies, that's up 300% since March. Primary care chain One Medical, their parent company, 1Life Health (NASDAQ:ONEM), IPO'd earlier this year, it's up 30%. So, I'm loving all of your insight on the digital health industry and I would love to know, what do you think about these types of stocks? Are they overhyped? Are they fairly valued? Or do you think we're just seeing the beginning and so they're really trading at a bargain still?

Torstensson: I think that's obviously the million-dollar question. I can look at it as an operator. The healthcare market is enormous in itself. Digital is really happening. As with any market, when you have those two combinations and through demand from users and consumers, payers, there's going to be winners and losers. So then, you need to go in and look at individual companies. I have spent 110% of my time on operating Lifesum so I can't go in and say, this is going to be the winner, this is not going to be the winner. But I'd be extremely surprised if there aren't multiple winners in this sector.

Cardina: Absolutely. One question is, this is from Mike Migliore, ""How does your technology compare to the tech used by Fitbit?"" This viewer says that they seem similar on the face.

Torstensson: What are you saying, developed for Android or iOS? I can't really speak on exactly how Fitbit's technology is built.

Cardina: Yeah, I hear you. Fitbit seems like it's more in the exercise side of things, and Lifesum is more about the nutrition. It sounds like together they could be excellent tools for someone who is trying to really take charge of their health and have better outcomes.

Torstensson: We support Fitbit integration within Lifesum. So, I think that's correct that they are more on the exercise movement side and we're 100% focused on delivering a really great experience, some food and nutrition.

Cardina: Awesome. So, I'm curious to hear about your personal nutrition journey. Is there any type of food that you love to eat that keeps you healthy? I'm a big foodie and home chef myself, so I love to hear ideas.

Torstensson: So my problem, and that's part of why I got involved with Lifesum, is I really love food, great food. So I probably eat a little bit too much. But I think it really goes back to finding a daily rhythm for at least most of the week for me to stay healthy, and it's about being a little bit smarter through breakfast, lunch, dinner, especially during the week. I have a sweet tooth as well, bread is my weakness, so for me, it's a lot about moderating that side to become a little bit healthier.

Cardina: Yes, absolutely. No one says you can't have bread, but maybe not bread with every meal every day.

Torstensson: No, but I think, and that's a lot around health and food, that it's actually not these enormous changes or crash diet approach, which is actually very hard to sustain. It's about finding a balance that's healthier than the one you have now if you're unhappy with your current health status.

Cardina: Right. A lot of the progress really happens on the margins if you can just get 10% better in a lot of ways, it can have an outsized impact. That's what I've found in my own health journey as well.

Torstensson: It will be a little bit like investing, that you have these compounding returns. You find the right balance and then it just builds.

Cardina: I love that connection, that's so true. So, to get back to investing a little bit, what is one thing our viewers should know about their own wellness in light of the pandemic? Do you have any favorite takeaways to share, whether it's about work-life balance, self love and acceptance, education, or even just that it's OK to have cake every once in a while? What do you think?

Torstensson: I think one of the takeaways from the pandemic specifically is actually that being overweight or obese actually seems to be one of the clear risk factors of getting a worse COVID experience. It's actually a good thing to think about, what am I eating, how is that impacting my health? Because that's one of the things we actually can impact seemingly when it comes to the pandemic.

Cardina: Yeah, that's so true. I think for a lot of us, the pandemic has made us feel very out of control. What I love about digital health apps as it pertains to exercise or nutrition is it can really make you feel in control and really give you your power back in a very stressful situation.

Torstensson: I fully agree.

Cardina: Awesome. So, are there any exciting developments coming up for Lifesum that you would like to talk about, maybe new partnerships, anything along those lines?

Torstensson: So for us, it's two months to the New Year, so we're heads down building the new version of Lifesum and working on new things. But I spent 20 years in digital, learnt that you should not pre-announce before you're actually done. I think that's a hard-learned lesson from before. So we're looking very much forward to continue to serve our users and add way more than 700,000 users per month over the next couple of months.

Cardina: Awesome. What is your marketing strategy behind that? Do you do most of the marketing on social media? Any thoughts there?

Torstensson: We always start with the product. I think for any digital product, that's where you really need to start because word-of-mouth, especially online, is so powerful. But we use social media, we use paid advertising, we use partnerships and we think that actually doing all of them well is one of the things that have driven us to, soon, 50 million users.

Cardina: Yeah, absolutely. When something works, you want to tell everybody about it. You said you spent a lot of time in digital. What were you doing before Lifesum?

Torstensson: So, just before Lifesum I headed the consumer subscription business at Spotify. So, almost 10 years ago now, just when Spotify was starting out. So I ran that for three years, and before that, I was with the company called Stardoll that was the biggest gaming in community website for teen and tween girls globally.

Cardina: Cool. I feel like, with a lot of apps like Lifesum, there is a gaming component. Do you think you learned a lot there that you've brought to Lifesum?

Torstensson: Absolutely. I think there are a few key learnings that we brought from entertainment into digital health. One is that it's about what the thumb wants to do, it needs to be fun. Also, it's really about giving good feedback, which gaming is about; you do something and you get the feedback, that is fun and you want to do more, and that's really part of great digital product design, health, wellness, gaming, whatever you're trying to build.

Cardina: Right, it really activates that reward pathway. I eat a salad, Lifesum tells me great job, I feel better than if I had a cheeseburger, and you repeat the process. Does that sound right?

Torstensson: That sounds about right.

Cardina: Awesome. Well, thank you so much, Henrik. Is there any last thing you want to say?

Torstensson: Thank you for having me. If anyone that's listening hasn't downloaded Lifesum, please do so.

Cardina: Absolutely. I know I'm going to enjoy using it. Thank you so much.

This video was recorded on November 11 , 2020.

David Gardner: Well, what a start to November, these markets are volatile. Volatile to the upside for some companies, volatile to the downside for others. Many of the companies that had won the first 10 months of 2020 are losing this week, and vice versa. But why spend much time talking about a given week or even a given year? Nope. When we invest, we invest for a minimum of three years, and that comes to mind in particular this week, because we're going to be reviewing a 5-Stock Sampler, one that was picked for a three-year minimum period, and it was two years ago this week that I selected 5 Stocks That Got Trouble. We'll be reviewing those.

And it's time for the latest 5-Stock Sampler, the 27th in our historical series, 5 Stocks That Will Press On.

A review of a past sampler, the creation of a new one, only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing.

And welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. I hope you enjoyed Stock Stories, Vol. 5 last week. I had a lot of fun learning through each of my teammates. And in fact, for each one, I said, hey, would you help me review a 5-Stock Sampler sometime this month? And so, that's exactly what Karl Thiel raised his hand to do earlier this month. Karl will be joining me shortly as we go over 5 Stocks That Got Trouble.

Well, last week, we reviewed 5 Stocks for Conscious Capitalism, and I'll mention, next week, we're going to review 5 Stocks That Let You Eat Cake. So yes, November has been a stock-picking time of year for this podcast. When you do it every year, when you review them every year, you're going to come back years later with multiple ones to do. And rather than have a Review-a-palooza! episode, where I could have done all three at once, I thought it was fun this month to break it up and have some new content each month as well. The focus this time is, as I mentioned last week, a new 5-Stock Sampler, this will be the 27th. I've done that every 10 weeks or so. And yup, we're up to about 270 or so fresh podcasts; I'm not even including the extras that we've thrown in on weekends over the years. So, it is that time once again for our newest 5-Stock Sampler. We'll do that in the second half, the back-half of the show, and I'll explain what I mean by 5 Stocks That Will Press On, when we get there.

But without further ado, let's start, and I'm going to ask Rick Engdahl if he could give us a little bit of way back music here.

Now, it's not that far back, admittedly, it's just two years ago, although, a lot of us feel like just a year ago, how different did a year ago feel from this November of 2020? Well, this is two years ago, and as November arrived, I didn't really have a great theme in mind for this particular 5-Stock Sampler, so I decided to be silly, I had already done it once in 2018. Earlier that year, I picked 5 Stocks That Are Mm-mmm Good. And well, the ""Mm-mmm"" was a pun, because it was five stocks that all started with the letter M. And that felt pretty good some months earlier in 2018, so as we arrived around Thanksgiving of 2018, I thought why not go with five stocks that start with a different letter, how about T? T might be Thanksgiving, but I also, for some reason, had in mind one of my better moments from high school, back in my musical theater days senior year, I got to be the music man in the classic American musical by the same name The Music Man. Harold Hill and for those familiar, you'll recognize Trouble with a capital T, and that rhymes of P, and that stands for Pool.

Now, I know all you folks are the right kind of parents, and I'm going to be perfectly frank, would you like to know what kind of conversation goes on when they're wandering around that hall and the lyrics go on? I still have them in my head, the signature song Trouble. And Trouble was particularly apt for that quarter, does everybody, especially investors among us, remember what was happening in the fourth quarter of 2018, how about a major nosedive for a lot of really great companies. 4Q 2018 was not kind at all to investors of any kind. And so, I specifically was looking at companies that were well down from their recent highs in 2018, those are 5 Stocks That Got Trouble, so we've got some Harold Hill mixed in, we've got some market conditions of 2018 mixed in.

And now, we have my friend Karl Thiel, mix him in. Karl, welcome.

Karl Thiel: Glad to be here. And I do have to say, I was excited to find out that apparently you can sing.

Gardner: [laughs] I mean, I kind of can, yeah, that's the only instrument I can play. I was always in the choir in college, I was in the glee club, and I was the musicals guy in high school. But I decided to dedicate my life instead, Karl, to The Motley Fool. There's an alternate universe where David Gardner is a very mediocre stage performer somewhere, but I'm just glad I'm not that version of me.

Thiel: [laughs] It's too much to hope for today, but I just really hope that Rick, our Producer, somehow figures out how to get you to sing on a podcast at some point.

Gardner: [laughs] Well, we'll leave that for another day, but it was fun to think about The Music Man as we thought about 5 Stocks That Got Trouble. And, Karl, you're here to help us think through what's happened in the two years since, so thank you for volunteering. My long time Rule Breaker analyst and friend, helping write up a lot of my picks in Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers over the years, and picking a bunch of them too. I know we've made much of your selection of Shopify for our team in Rule Breakers, the first one to bring it to The Motley Fool.

You're too humble to mention that, but I do like to brag on my friends, and, Karl, you've picked many great stocks in Rule Breakers. I think at least one of these might be yours, not one of your best picks, I think, 5 Stocks That Got Trouble, you can talk about that or not if you want to, but actually now, looking over, I see one of your best picks also in 5 Stocks That Got Trouble, so this will be, I'm glad I'm reviewing this with you. Karl, are you ready?

Thiel: I am.

Gardner: All right. Well, Karl, as is our tradition, we're going to go worst to first on 5 Stocks That Got Trouble. So, let's start with ticker symbol TWOU. The company is 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU). The stock is down 42% over the last two years. Now, I'll mention right now that the stock market, over the last two years since November 14th, 2018, right as you and I are talking at 3:19 PM Eastern on Tuesday, November 10th, which happens to be my wife's birthday, Happy Birthday, Margaret! Stock market is up 30.8% since that day two years ago. So, that's what we're shooting for, we'll round it to 31%. So, with 2U, Karl, down 42%, we start -73% in the hole, -42% versus a market of +31%. Ouch! what has been happening with 2U?

Thiel: Well, one thing I have to say is that this got way worse just yesterday. 2U was down 20% yesterday, so it would look a little bit better if we had done this podcast a week earlier. But, yeah, this is one for which I bear some personal responsibility. [laughs] And it's a shame, because I really like their mission, which is basically online education, but not just online education the way everybody's kids are doing it at school, but really, kind of, scripted, prepared, very well-organized online education. They talk about how every class involves more filmed content than a season of Game of Thrones.

The company did very well, it had kind of a SaaS model to bring to this. They take a share of tuition revenue for the programs they set up. They enter very long contracts, and they have a great deal of visibility, because these contracts are +10 years. So, nobody is going to, like, suddenly skip out on them. What is less predictable, however, is how much enrollment they get. And as a lot of competition mounted and they were having some enrollment problems, they suddenly changed tack in July of 2019 and said, we're not going to set up so many of these programs, we're going to grow out in different directions with more fee-for-service short courses and things like that, and the market just flipped out, it was down 60%-some the day that they announced that.

Gardner: It's funny to think, just two years ago, Karl, this was one of the 5 Stocks That Got Trouble, and what was the trouble? Well, the stock had crested high $90s in the Summer of 2018, and all of a sudden it had dropped to $51, which is roughly our cost basis from two years ago this week, and then it nosedived to about $10 based on the events that you just described. And depending on when you bought the stock, you either love it, hate it, or maybe you're somewhere in-between. Because if you did buy at $10 right around August of last year, August 2019, my golly! Even after the 20% drop, you have a 3-bagger.

Thiel: That's right.

Gardner: But at the same time, Karl, looking at the stock in 2020, you would think 2U would be just a total hero. With so many kids distance learning, the company seems so well set up. It has had a pretty good year, I mean, it started this year right around $22, so now it's at $30, but I mean, there are a lot of stocks up a lot more than that that are less favored by these circumstances.

Thiel: If you take it right off of its March low, it is up about 200% since then, but yeah, it's not done as well for a company that seems to be in a great position. It is moving -- its business model means that it moves forward somewhat slowly as it sets these things up. I think what's ironic about it is that their plan was to temper revenue growth and focus more on operational efficiency, and if you look at what's happened since then, revenue growth has actually almost never missed a beat, they were growing in the 30s percentage-wise before, they've continued to grow in the 30s percentage-wise ever since, whereas [laughs] losses have widened. And they've, kind of, hinted around more recently that they might get a little more aggressive about adding on some of these programs.

Gardner: And thinking, again, about that 20% drop earlier this week, Karl, it was one of those stocks that, I mean, I saw Zoom go down 15% or so on Monday. Zoom didn't have any bad earnings announcement, it's just there was a real shift away from stocks that benefit from the stay-at-home life that most of us have enjoyed, or not, in 2020. There was no bad earnings announcement from 2U. CEO Chip Paucek didn't step down or anything like that, this stock just dropped 20% in sympathy with those kinds of moves. So, interesting to see just how volatile in a single day a stock like this could be.

But we continue to actively recommend 2U, to hold out good hope for it, and remember, this three-year game we're playing for 5 Stocks That Got Trouble, will end next year, not right now, so we'll see where 2U is one year hence.

Well, thank you for that, Karl.

All right. So, from worst to first, that was the worst. And here's some good news my fellow Fools and listeners, and anybody who was listening to the podcasts two years ago, may have bought one or more, except for 2U, of these stocks all the rest are winners. And boy! Does this get spectacular. But let's stick quickly with performer No. 2, the second-worst here, Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO), ticker symbol TTWO. Take-Two Interactive, the video game company, up 45%, again, versus the market's 31%, so that's a +14%, helping us retrace some of our losses from 2U.

Karl, any words on Take-Two?

Thiel: Yeah, I feel a little aggrieved on behalf of Take-Two. I mean, obviously, they handily beat the market, but I was surprised that they didn't do even better, because to some extent this is a ""obvious COVID winner"" with everybody gaming at home and everything. And they have done well. There was a moment in March where they're actually underwater from your pick two years ago, but that's, obviously, reversed itself. And I would say that a big part of it is that, kind of, the big catalysts for the stock were already in place at the time you mentioned it, Red Dead Redemption 2 was already out; obviously, that's been a big driver. Grand Theft Auto V online, just continues to bring in players, that was also already in place, although --

Gardner: Isn't that amazing? I mean, when that came out, I'm always a day-one buyer for AAA titles for consoles, so I bought it the first day. I didn't understand or know at the time that I was buying not just a DVD that I could stick in my console and play once. And by the way, I never finished any of the Grand Theft Auto games. I always buy them, [laughs] play them about half way through, and then get distracted by a squirrel. But little did I, or many of us, know at the time that, wow! Take-Two had plans to turn that into Game-as-a-Service GaaS, not just SaaS. I mean, pretty much 10 years later, games like World of Warcraft, Grand Theft Auto V, etc. The gifts that keep on giving, and it's just been an incredible story. They are trying to do the same thing with Red Dead Redemption too, by the way.

Thiel: Yeah, I think that looks like another, sort of, forever title for them. And they were hitting new monthly active user records in 2020 for GTA V, which, I mean, when you think about it, that is a seven-year old game, it's amazing.

Gardner: Yeah. All right. Well, we could say more about Take-Two, but let's keep moving, we got a lot to cover still. So, stock No. 3, the third worst performer or at this point, I can say the third best performer, sleepy Trex (NYSE:TREX), ticker symbol TREX. Yup, one of those companies whose name is its ticker symbol, was a stock that got trouble two years ago in the fourth quarter of 2018. I'm glad we recognized it then, the stock was at $29.54, today it's at $68.69. Yup, that's up 133%. So, if you deduct the market's 31%, we're left with +102 points of alpha; that on its own wipes out 2U and leaves us some profits on the table.

Karl, anything you want to say about this outdoor composite decking manufacturer?

Thiel: Well, this is another one that's seen some pretty big COVID gains, but it was actually up significantly before that. I do think there's something of a COVID home improvement angle, and that's actually been borne out in the numbers. Revenue growth was 8.9% in 2019, it's accelerated to 13.4% over the last 12 months. So, I think it's legit that it is actually seeing a boost. This is also one that had a big dip in March. And also, a company that took a fairly big bath yesterday. But at their low ebb in March, they were momentarily underwater from your pick two years ago, but did not last long, and they've obviously done incredibly since then.

The only other thing I'd say about it is that I can't face Rick Munarriz, if I don't mention the suburbanization trend that he's been, sort of, hammering on recently, which is just people moving out of cities and into more suburban areas to get a little more space, and that comes along with fixing up a deck.

Gardner: I'm glad you mentioned Rick, Rick will be joining you and me, I think, along with Maria Gallagher, on Thursday on Motley Fool Live. So, for Rule Breaker members and Motley Fool members, you can point your browser at Live.Fool.com at noon Eastern on Thursday, where Rick will probably talk some more about suburbanization, but our longtime friend and an analyst on Rule Breakers, Rick, also having brought so many great stocks. And in fact, it was you and Rick who partnered to bring the best performer; we'll talk about that in just a little bit, to this 5-Stock Sampler.

But before we go to stock No. 2, I just want to say that I love Trex. I mean, I love that we brought to Rule Breakers, first recommended on July 25th, 2012, so here we are eight years later. This is not a SaaS company; this is not really a high-tech company of any kind. Our cost basis on July 25th, 2012, this reminds us of the benefits of true investing as practiced by Fools everywhere, and especially in Rule Breakers, our cost basis is $3.38 for Trex, it's rocking over $79 as we speak. This is a 23-bagger for a company that a lot of people have still never heard of, whose market cap is under $10 billion. I really like the future for this company.

All right, that takes us to the second-best performer. Now, the second-best performer is a company that could not have been more favored, probably, in present conditions, and I'm talking about Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC), ticker symbol TDOC. Yup, another stock that starts with a T, that had some trouble two years ago in the fourth quarter of 2018. Boy! Am I glad we snapped it up with this sampler at $57.40, because today it's right over $173/share. That is a 3-bagger ladies and gentlemen and Fools, the stock is up 202%, again, against the market's 31%, that gives us a +171% in the win column. Anything more than the very obvious statement that Teladoc is extremely favored in 2020, that you'd like to share with us.

Thiel: Yeah, I was going to say, there's no false drama that there's an obvious COVID angle here. This is one of the few stocks that I looked at that had no appreciable dip in March, right, almost everything dipped in March, Teladoc really pretty much didn't. But I will say that the company had had a good run before we recommended it and was actually kind of sleepy in the first year after you recommended it but it was ramping up in the months prior to COVID, which actually pretty well coincided with our second recommendation of it. They've just had consistently strong earnings. It's just been excellent performance, and obviously, that did get really goosed by the pandemic.

I think the other big, sort of, factor with the stock right now, is their merger with Livongo.

Gardner: Right. A company I didn't even know about two years ago, we couldn't have known that at the time or at least predicted it, and yet, this is now emerging as an integrated future-facing healthcare monster kind of company, I think.

Thiel: Yeah, I really like it, but I will say it's not something that's driven returns really; the stock kind of dropped after it was announced and hasn't really come back since. I think, hopefully, people will come to appreciate it eventually.

Gardner: All right. Well, that brings us to stock No. 1 from 5 Stocks That Got Trouble. Now, a reminder, while we're celebrating extreme outperformance, this game was set for three years. So, we're past halftime, we're in the second half, but a lot more could still happen in the year ahead, the market might sell-off in the year ahead, I wouldn't be surprised if at some point it does, and these stocks would go down with it. We saw 2U losing 20% of its value in a single day earlier this week, with no material information from the company. Anyway, with all that said, we should celebrate great performance, and let's go ahead and do that.

Before I mention the top performing stock, let's just look at the math of the first four. So, we had a -73% for 2U, we had a +14% for Take-Two, we had a +102% for Trex, and a +171% for Teladoc. Now, if you're keeping score at home, we have 214 points of alpha, that's just outperformance of the S&P 500 among those four companies, if you added it up, and now on top of that, +214, get ready Fools, here comes ticker symbol TTD, the company is The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). It was a stock that was in some trouble two years ago, in the fourth quarter 2018 we scooped it for this 5-Stock Sampler at $116.51. As we speak this afternoon, Karl, it's just over $708, so not bad performance in two years, from $116 to $708. That equates to 508% of gain, that's a six-bagger, again, versus 31% [laughs] for all the S&P 500. Winning by 477%, just for this stock alone. If you add that to the 214%, we get +691 points of outperformance from just five little stocks shared in the sampler at a dark time two years ago.

Karl, you and Rick Munarriz brought The Trade Desk idea to me as the advisor of Rule Breakers, I looked over the various stocks we had that month, boy! Am I glad I listened to you guys, and together we made The Trade Desk a Rule Breaker. What's been going on with The Trade Desk?

Thiel: Just incredible execution. You know, obviously, that kind of gain isn't made overnight, it's come steadily, but I mean, I should have mentioned, they just had blowout earnings announced a few days ago, and the company multi spiffy-popped; is there actually a word for that, David?

Gardner: Yes, there is, in fact, when you have a spiffy-pop, and I think most of our listeners know, but we have a lot of new listeners this year. So, a spiffy-pop is when a stock makes more money in a single day then you paid for it whenever you first bought that stock. So, yes, for example, if you bought a stock at $100/share and some far-flung future day, it goes up in a single day, let's say, from $200 to $317, it goes up $117 in one day. Well, that's more than the $100 you paid for, that's a spiffy-pop.

Now, if your stock goes up a multiple of your cost basis, Karl, and Fools everywhere, the way we account for that is we say it's a spiffy-two-pop or a spiffy-three-pop. We've had spiffy +10 pops sometimes through great companies held for long periods of time, like Amazon or Netflix. But wow! Really spectacular to think that we could have a multi spiffy-pop, a spiffy-two-pop or spiffy-three-pop for a stock that we've held for less than four years; in this sampler, of course, just two years old. So, yeah, it happened, didn't it?

Thiel: It did. I think it might have been a spiffy-five-pop, I'm not sure, it was big anyway. [laughs] They did it in the best possible way too. I mean, I always love when earnings come in way ahead of estimates, but they just blew away revenue expectations as well by over 20%, which is really just a sign of a very healthy business. What's interesting about this one is that, unlike a lot of companies, this was initially, I think, regarded as facing a big COVID headwind, right? So, as we first went into lockdown, advertising was, you know, sort of one of the obvious ""losers"" in the marketplace. And you did see that, the stock did actually drop to a low of $136 on March 19. So, as of yesterday, this is probably wrong by a little bit, but it's up 460% since March off that level.

Gardner: Wow! Yeah, just unbelievable. Well, there it is, 5 Stocks That Got Trouble after two years, as presented to us by Karl Thiel. Karl, thank you very much for your efforts. And let's just go with the full accounting here. So, on average, these five stocks are up 169%, the market up 30.8%. That means, on average, each of these five stocks is outperforming the S&P 500 in a two-year period by 138.2%. We won't have many better 5-Stock Samplers Fools, but I'll tell you this, we've had some amazing 5-Stock Samplers, [laughs] and this is yet another. So, 5 Stocks That Got Trouble.

It's just a pleasure to see, as I plan ahead, weeks ahead for this podcast, to see, oh, yeah, we're going to get to review that 5-Stock Sampler coming up. And spoiler alert, next week's a pretty good one too. So, despite some market volatility, it is awfully fun to just think in multiyear increments and see the benefits of Rule Breaker Investing. And these five stocks, that had a lot of trouble two years ago, remind us that if you press on and hold great companies through thick-and-thin, and if they're great companies, and if you, this is about you, press on, you can enjoy real rewards.

Karl, thank you again.

Thiel: Thanks for having me. It's fun to do when the news is this good.

Gardner: Yeah. In fact, let's both pin something on our calendar so that you are the analyst who joins me for this group one year from now as we close it out. Love to hear you, again, on what's happened in the meantime, but boy! Karl, you've been awfully good luck for this 5-Stock Sampler. Thanks.

[...]

Well, I'm glad I found myself saying ""press on"" toward the end of that segment, because that is directly relevant to what we'll be spending time with for the rest of this week's podcast, and that is 5 Stocks That Will Press On.

Well, I've mentioned we've done this 26 times before, each time I've thought, what's a good theme, what's a good message? Sometimes I don't come up with a good theme or message, so I go silly and just pick all stocks and start with the letter M, or the letter T. But now, reviewing the 5-Stock Sampler from this year, and it's sort of a tale of what's happened in 2020. This will be the fifth 5-Stock Sampler of this year.

We started the year in January with 5 Stocks That Spark Joy. I was thinking about a new year, new aspirations, Marie Kondo, MarKon-ing up your house, if you will. Anybody can go back and listen to that again, if they want to understand what I mean when I talk about MarKon. But that was the 5-Stock Sampler to kick off the year. I didn't know much about COVID on January 22nd of this year, I just came up with 5 Stocks That Spark Joy. But then we jumped forward to April 8th, 5 Stocks for the Coronavirus, couldn't have been more apposite. Of course, a dark time, it didn't feel great to be picking stocks in April. We'll see next April how those five stocks are doing.

From April, we then went forward to June, 5 Stocks for America. America was hurting quite a lot in June. I was also thinking about America's birthday some weeks hence 5 Stocks for America. And then, well, just a couple of months ago now, early September, 5 Stocks Indistinguishable from Magic. So, we went through Marie Kondo, the coronavirus, America, and hi-tech, but here we are in November of 2020. We just come through a pretty brutal election cycle. I say pretty brutal, but they all have kind of felt that [laughs] way for me for some years now. I don't really enjoy the distraction of the elections. I'm pretty apolitical. I think anybody who's got to know me or is stuck with this podcast for months or years knows that already.

I spend most of my time thinking about the private sector, that's where most of us work every day providing products or services that solve other people's problems or present some wonderful new possibilities, the innovators out there. The private sector is the largest employer in this country. Most of us every day are enriched and have our lives enriched by the work of our fellow Americans. And here not, I shouldn't just say Americans, because we import a lot of great foreign products. We are global, we are traders, we're improving each other's lives through conscious capitalism.

I'm always excited about the future of conscious capitalism, but as we think now about where we are in November of 2020, two things come to mind. There's still a lot of talk and some confusion, I think, about the election, but I'm also thinking about the excitement of a potential vaccine and what that's done to the markets, but at the same time I'm thinking about what's probably going to be a hard Winter, because that vaccine, even as its rushed to markets in December and reaches some of the most needy people right away, and I think that's so wonderful, I think we all also have to recognize, very high numbers of COVID spreading, both in the United States and many countries around the world, and it's about to get more indoors, colder, and a little bit more locked down.

So, I'm thinking about all of those things, and I go back to one of my favorite quotes from former President Calvin Coolidge. Now, I don't know a lot about Coolidge. If you started quizzing me on Coolidge as a President, I wouldn't do so well, but I practically have what I consider to be his greatest quote memorized, and in fact, I once shared it on a previous podcast, as many of you know, I do great quotes podcasts from time-to-time, one or two a year. And Great Quotes, Vol. 5, I'm now seeing it, Great Quotes, Vol. 5 was entitled A Fool to Make You Merry. One of those quotes was from Shakespeare, that was the title of that show.

But on that show January 4th, 2017, I presented Coolidge's great press on quote, and that is the quote that gives us our theme for this 5-Stock Sampler. And let's go to the quote right now. Here it is. ""Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men ... "" we can also say women, of course, these days "" ... with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius ... "" said Coolidge, "" ... is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan ""press on"" has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race."" Press on. Yup, press on through this election season, press on through this coming Winter. Press on from two years ago when the markets were in a really bad place and a lot of stocks had trouble, press on with this group of stocks, press on tomorrow, press on next year, press on fellow travelers. If you're human and listening to me, I hope you are pressing on. I agree that resilience and persistence are some of the most powerful forces I've seen, and it starts with the human heart, the human mind and your own resolve or not.

Well, the five stocks that I have in mind have pressed on, in many cases, for decades. But that was then, this is now. While they've been spectacular performers in some cases in the past, every 5-Stock Sampler is picked for the future. I have no knowledge, [laughs] in many cases, of what the future holds, both next year or three years from now or three decades from now, but I've found that when you find great horses and you look at the jockeys too, you bet on the right ones and you let them race, you let them press on, boy! Can they create some special things for your portfolio; as so many of our 5-Stock Samplers and the services behind them, of course, have proven. So, press on.

Now, if you're disappointed by the results of the U.S. election, I say to you press on, continue to work toward what are your own highest aims. If you are happy about the results of the U.S. election, press on, you now have a tailwind, the winds have shifted, make the best of it. But whoever you are, when you hear ""press on,"" you think, I'm going to win it for me and my peeps now, and those other people, that other half, they're going to lose, then I don't want you to press on. I don't think that's the right way to think or act in life, that certainly does not lead to a better America for me and for you and for all of us.

So, I say, to those who are the ""for"" people, do you remember what Roy Spence said some years ago on this podcast, he said, I'm a ""for"" person. I'm for this, for the good things, for all people. He meant, I'm not an ""against"" person. And along with Roy, I'm a ""for"" person too; I hope you are. And I want the ""for"" people to press on. This message, and this 5-Stock Sampler is for you.

So, if you're a ""for"" person, join me and let's press on.

All right. Without further ado, 5 Stocks That Will Press On, we'll do then alphabetically by company name, which means we're going to start with Canadian National (NYSE:CNI), the ticker symbol is CNI. This is, of course, a Canadian company, and if you don't already know it, you should have seen ""CN"" on the sides of railroad cars probably throughout your life, I'll be presenting for each of these companies a little bit of its history to remind us of where this company came from, how it started, and how it's pressing on. And Canadian National, the first alphabetically, also happens to be the business that's been in business for the longest period; I'll talk about that in a sec.

But first, let me just mention, the market cap for Canadian National is at $76.3 billion, so a $76 billion market cap, that's also the largest market cap of these five companies. The stock recently traded today at about $109/share. We first picked this for Motley Fool Stock Advisor, I picked it at $19.17 in March of 2008. So, here we are 12.5 years later, it's gone from $19.17 to about $109 today. That's a gain of 468%, but who's counting against the S&P 500's gain of 250%, which is a nice 12 years for the S&P. The stock roughly doubled it off of a pretty boring business. Not exactly the most Rule Breaker-y company I can think of, but that's kind of the point about pressing on.

So, quick history for Canadian National. The company was founded in 1919. The Canadian government was assembling some of the bankrupt railways at the time, along with some of the government-owned railways, and that's what created Canadian National. The company would not IPO until 1995; that's right 76 years after its founding it finally IPO'd when the Canadian government decided that privatizing its railroad would lead likely to increased productivity, I predict that has happened, it's been very evident in the superior performance of this company judged against its peers, and obviously, against the S&P 500.

Just a few more notes about this company before we move on to the next one. All of its numbers were pretty much down for the third quarter, right, wouldn't you expect that as business slows down, probably the rails are slowing down too? Except by the way, for grains, both Canadian grain and U.S. grain, those businesses at or near all-time highs. And in fact, Canadian National has started to add additional grain-focused cars and some better technology to move grain, as that will be a big thing not just this year but going into next. But the company's free cash flow recently, as it reported its third quarter, down from $700 million to $506 million, but notice, it's still pretty healthy. We're still talking about a company pulling in $0.5 billion in free cash flow for that period. It's been getting a lot more efficient operationally and lowering its cost here throughout 2020. So, I predict as the economy recovers, this company will benefit from the steps it's been taking in 2020.

I'm going to share one other quick line, this is from our ticker guide, so if you're a Motley Fool member, and darn it! Why wouldn't you be, if you're a Stock Advisor member, where Canadian National is included on my side of the Stock Advisor scorecard, you're familiar with our discussion boards. And we have a number of farm teamers, what we call contracting analysts, people like you and me living around the country around the world, who help cover our stocks. And Chad Ferguson has done that for many companies, but Canadian National is one of them, and I was reading a recent discussion board post by him reflecting on this most recent quarter. And I'm going to quote him here, he said, ""They are also very aware of upcoming potential long-term disruptors, like driverless trucks and the battle for control over freight sales by competing channels. Management continues to push forward with their agenda on the modernization of railroad operations, as well as everything from robotic process automation of everyday tasks to the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence."" Yup, and we're talking about railroads.

By the way, got to pump up Chad a little bit further here, his Caps rating is 96.40. So, Chad is one of those great community contributors who has been picking stocks out there on our Caps platform and exceeding 96% of all others doing so. Chad, thank you for all your contributions. So, there you have it, Fools, stock No. 1 for the 5 Stocks That Will Press On, Canadian National, ticker symbol CNI.

All right, stock No. 2. Let's stick with the letter C, and let's make it Cirrus Logic, ticker symbol CRUS. Cirrus Logic, a market cap of $4.3 billion, much smaller than Canadian National. The stock is trading around $75/share as we record Tuesday afternoon. I first picked this stock in Motley Fool Stock Advisor, March 2018, 2.5 years ago, it was at $43.06, today up at $75. That means it's up about 74%, the market up about half of that. So, this has been an outperformer. You'll notice that I tend to pick winners in my 5-Stock Samplers. And then we go on and we win with all of our 5-Stock Samplers. I hope that's instructive for all of us. It's something that I had to learn and train myself to do as a younger Fool, and it continues to reward me decades later.

All right. A little bit of history about Cirrus Logic. This company was created in 1981, its name back then was Patil Systems, that's because Suhas Patil, who is an Indian-American entrepreneur, that's right, he grew up in India, but he's one of those amazing people that then came to school here in the U.S., in fact, he got graduate degrees at MIT, and then he just stayed here, and he created Patil Systems in 1981. Three years later, it would move from Salt Lake City, Utah to Silicon Valley, as Silicon Valley began to heat up in the 1980s. Cirrus Logic has been there ever since. The company IPO'd in 1989, so eight years after its founding. It's worth noting that it's been a public company for 31 years, pressing on through all kinds of market conditions, pressing on to being a market leader and a market beater.

So, I really like this company, that's why I picked it 2.5 years ago for Motley Fool Stock Advisor at, of course, a lower cost basis. It's been a big-time market beater over the long term. Now, Apple makes up 70% of its revenue. This is a fabless semiconductor. That means these guys design semiconductor chips, but they don't actually manufacture them, they outsource their manufacturing, their fabrication, so it's a fabless semiconductor company. That enables it to have fewer employees and higher margins than companies that do the manufacturing. So, again, Apple makes up, traditionally, the majority of its revenue, but it's a key part of the iPhone. The audio integrated circuits for the phone have come from Cirrus Logic, also the company has a presence in the technology of the AirPods. So, if you like your Apple AirPods, that audio, you're benefiting from Cirrus Logic's work.

Now, of course, with so much reliance on the iPhone and Apple, that is a vulnerability of Cirrus Logic, which is in part why its multiple, the company's valuation, is understandably reduced as a consequence. But its possibilities for AirPods, and just you think about iPhone 12 and the relationship it's built up with Apple over the years, you know, some people are pointing out AirPods could eventually monitor your pulse. Yeah, you thought you were just listening to music in your ear, but they can be pulse monitors, there are other more health-focused aspects, there could be voice, biometrics, all bound up in AirPods of the present and/or future. So, it gives the company some possibilities of optionality.

Also, this company gets great employee reviews, check it out on Glassdoor. A top governance score, from those who study governance. And for us, a risk rating of just 8. Now, if you're among a Motley Fool member, if you're a member of Stock Advisor or Rule Breakers, you'll recognize my risk ratings, I'm not going to cover them here. I'm just going to say, a pretty low-risk company that you're getting with good growth and great history.

So, there is stock No. 2, Cirrus Logic, ticker symbols CRUS.

All right, stock No. 3, we'll drop down to the letter E. The company is Ecolab (NYSE:ECL), ticker symbol ECL. Ecolab is a $61 billion market cap, so much closer in size to Canadian National than to Cirrus Logic. By the way, I want to pause it for one quick sec there. For fans of our Market Cap Gameshow, you know that sometimes I've talked about how somebody makes a horrifically wrong guess on a company's market cap, and when they overestimate it, when they guess a market cap of $25 billion and the company only has an actual market cap of $5 billion, I've sometimes said, that's a pretty good indicator that maybe you should be thinking hard about adding that stock to your watchlist or your portfolio, if you thought it had a much bigger presence in the world than its present valuation reflects, that's a good watchlist stock.

Well, I wanted to say that in closing, going back to Cirrus Logic for a quick sec, Cirrus Logic, only a $4 billion market cap. That surprised me as I prepped this 5-Stock Sampler.

Anyway, let's return now to Ecolab. $61 billion market cap, as we're talking, the stock is trading at around $212/share. This is a company that pays a dividend, pays a dividend of about 1%. By the way, there's another dividend payer, I didn't mention this early, but Canadian National pays about a 1.6% yield on its dividend. So, the interest rate that you get paid to hold the stock is sometimes how I've discussed the dividend yield. So, just highlighting a couple of dividend payers, not surprising, among ""press on"" stocks.

Well, I first recommended Ecolab in June of 2016 for Motley Fool Stock Advisor, it was at $113.27 that day. So, here's the good news, it's up 87.4%, the not great news, the market is up 86.9% over those 4 1/2 years, meaning this is only ahead of the S&P 500 so far for me by 1%, it's pretty much been a market performer. But I'm not looking backward, right, you and I are looking forward to this 5-Stock Sampler. So, let's count on Ecolab to continue to beat the market, but let's hope by maybe more than 1%.

Little bit of history, that's part of what I'm doing with our press on stocks this podcast. This company was founded in 1923. Yup, just four years after Canadian National, it was called Economics Laboratory back then, hence the name today, Ecolab. Economics Laboratory had this tag line in 1923, ""Saving time, lightening labor, and reducing costs to those we serve."" So, that was Economics Laboratory back then, but today, Economics Laboratory is a very full-featured company. You know, its initial product, back in 1923 was called Absorbit. It quickly cleaned carpets in hotel rooms. That's what they went with. Then they started adding soaps and started buying other companies. Today this company helps clean up the world in more instances and contexts than I could possibly reflect briefly in this 5-Stock Sampler for you. But if you don't know that much about Ecolab, go to Ecolab.com, its website, and learn a lot more about the important work this company does every day.

This is one of those companies that passes my snap test. If we snapped our fingers and Ecolab disappeared last night, the St. Paul, Minnesota company would be dearly missed by many, from hospitals, to the public sector, all kinds of different instances where Ecolab is making the world cleaner.

I will mention, this is very recent news, it's going to have a new CEO, Christophe Beck, succeeding CEO Doug Baker. Beck, by the way, has been President and COO of the company. So, this is one of those companies that promotes from within, and probably had succession set up years ago. So, expect the same thing that I hope to see in our society, which is a peaceful transition of power. Two other things to close on Ecolab. First of all, this company IPO'd, I mentioned the IPO years of each of these stocks, this company IPO'd in 1957. So, 34 years after its founding, and yet, it's now been public for 63 years. Talk about pressing on. Three years from now, Ecolab will celebrate its 100th anniversary as a company.

And the second and last thing I'd like to say, this stock has a very low risk rating. I have had it calculated at different points as low as just 4 on my 25-point risk scale. The stock has beaten the market, though not by a huge amount, as I mentioned, but this feels like a company I want to be invested in, in the next 10 years, and at least for this sampler, for the next three.

All right, Canadian National, Cirrus Logic, Ecolab. Stock No. 4, ticker symbol ODFL. Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL). This is a stock that has appeared in at least one other 5-Stock Sampler. It's one of my go-to stocks when I think about the kinds of businesses that most people ignore as unexciting. Earlier, Karl and I got to share the story of Trex, a rather unexciting business, and yet, wow! What great companies these are for investors.

I first found Old Dominion Freight Line for Motley Fool Stock Advisor members in May of 2017. So, here we are, 3.5 years later, the stock back then at $56.55, $56.5, today it's up at $197. It's up about 250% versus the market's 60%. So yes, Old Dominion Freight Line has been spectacular. I've been talking about the market caps for each of these companies, Old Dominion Freight Line has a market cap of $23 billion. It pays a scanty dividend, not really worth talking about.

A little bit of history, Old Dominion Freight Line was founded in 1934 by Earl and Lillian Congdon. Don't you love this founding story? A couple. And it started as a single truck going between Richmond and Norfolk, Virginia, back-and-forth. Unfortunately, Earl died some time later, Lillian takes over as President, bringing in her sons. Now, here we are decades later. One of those sons remains the Senior Executive Chairman, he's been on the Board for 68 years. The company, I think it was for the first time, in 2011 appointed a non-family member as CEO, Greg Gantt has been doing a good job since 2011. But the Congdon family owns about one-sixth [16.666%] of this company. So, if you're a shareholder, you've got people deeply invested in it right along with you, creating wins every day. The company IPO'd in 1991. Yup, 57 years after it was founded, so it's been pressing on as a public company for 29 years now.

Well, I really like this company, I've talked about it before. It's highly profitable. It's a less-than-truckload carrier, which is a harder business to do, right. If you're just filling up an entire truck, going from point A. to point B., that's one thing, and that is the majority of the industry. By the way, here's a big picture fun stat, trucking as an industry accounts for about four-fifths [80%] of all U.S. transportation revenue. Trucking is a huge part of our daily life. The easier business to run is when you just send a full truck from one point to another. When you are filling a truck with multiple different things, and therefore it's less than a full truckload, and it's going multiple places, all of a sudden, you get into more complex logistics that need technology well-deployed and a very able workforce.

And this is something I've always admired about Old Dominion Freight Line, no unionized workers, why? Presumably because nobody ever felt they had to unionize against how they were being treated by the Congdon family. The company has more than 17,000 employees today. It uses flexible scheduling, it trains employees to perform multiple tasks, that allows for greater productivity, higher levels of customer service then you're going to find among its competitors. You know, ODFL focuses on employee communication, on continued education, development, motivation. It includes an opportunity for qualified employees to complete its Old Dominion Driver Training Program. So, you might have come in as a customer service person, and you end up being a fully fledged trucker, if in fact that is your dream. By the way, every driver can receive a safe driving bonus, traditionally, of up to $3,000 for safe driving. Who doesn't like that, as well?

One other thing I really like about Old Dominion, they have a partnership with Major League Baseball, if you're an MLB fan, you've probably seen a lot of Old Dominion Freight Line branding, if you think back on the previous few seasons. ODFL is a partner of Major League Baseball.

So, yup, there it is, press on stock No. 4. They've been pressing on since 1934. All that matters is, what happens next, let's call, through 2034. Press on ODFL.

All right. And that brings us to our final stock for this 5-Stock Sampler. Let's go all the way to the end of the alphabet, shall we? Let's go to ticker symbol ZBRA, that's Zebra Technologies. Zebra Technologies has a market cap of $18.5 billion. The stock was recently trading, today anyway, at around $345/share. This is a more recent entrant to Motley Fool services, I first picked it in November of 2018. Yup, two years ago this month. That's exactly the same month we picked 5 Stocks That Got Trouble, the sampler reviewed earlier. November of 2018, Zebra was at $178.91. So, at $345 today, it's up 93%, the market up about 35% over that time, a substantial market outperformer.

Zebra Technologies started in 1969 as Data Specialties, Inc. a lot has changed since 1969. This company IPO'd in 1991. Zebra is today the global leader in what it calls automatic identification and data capture. They've even acronymized that to AIDC, yup, Automatic Identification and Data Capture. Zebra is the leader; it's got 40% market share of barcode printing and mobile scanning.

Let's talk briefly about barcodes. Yup, that's where the name Zebra comes from, black-and-white stripes. Think about how ubiquitous barcodes are today. I don't think barcodes are going to get disrupted or taken out any time soon. Why? Well, in part because it costs less than $0.01 to add a barcode to something. In other words, I don't see anything cheaper coming along any time soon and displacing barcodes. But the number of things that are having codes put on them and need to be scanned to track the world around us is substantial.

And this company made a brilliant acquisition in 2014, it bought a portion of Motorola's business, Motorola's Solutions business. And the CEO who drove that, Anders Gustafsson, remains the CEO today, now in his 13th year. So, today Zebra has a robust healthcare business. Think about patient bracelets, think about bedside scanning, but one of its more recent acquisitions actually does NFL player tracking technology. Three customers account for about half of all revenues, which is always going to be a little bit of a vulnerability. But again, I love the clear leadership position of this company, I love its technology relevance, we talked about low price points on products, [laughs] like, barcodes, less than $0.01. RFID tags, by the way, which is also a big part of this business, radio frequency identification tags, cost about $0.05. We're talking about incredibly cheap stuff, then Zebra sells people scanners to scan. So, I love the ubiquity of what's happening. Also, another very low risk rating stock, typically rocking a risk rating around 8. This company pays no dividend.

As we move toward the holiday time of year, when you're buying gifts, have you ever done what I do, which is I pop open my Amazon app on my mobile phone, my iPhone, pop open the Amazon app. And I want to buy something or rebuy something that's near me, and so I just aim the Amazon app camera, my camera, at the barcode of whatever I want to order, and right away Amazon magically produces the page that leads me to that product so I can buy it again. That's another great simple use of a barcode, thinking about the relevance for all of us.

So, to stock No. 5, Zebra Technologies, I say, press on!

Well, I hope you've enjoyed this trip, in some cases, down memory lane. I love the origin stories of public companies, thinking about who started them, what was the name, what were they doing and how long ago. And I've intentionally selected companies that I believe have not just pressed on so successfully, measured in decades, as public companies and private before that, but I believe will press on from here no matter what happens in the world at large.

I was making a joke last week on the podcast that I might name the sampler 5 Stocks Should the World End, because I was feeling as if people were a little too alarmist about what's happening in our world. And if you do find yourself in alarm or surrounded by alarmists, remember the phrase ""press on,"" go look up the Coolidge quote again, memorize it, if you will, and think about these five public companies, all of which have been market beaters, each of which, I certainly hope and expect will continue to beat the market at least as a 5-Stock Sampler. Let's hope we can maintain our outstanding record of finding winning stocks in these 5-Stock Samplers. Press on!

Well, next week, we'll be reviewing our last November 5-Stock Sampler. I'll have my friend Rick Munarriz in for 5 Stocks That Let You Eat Cake, that and other delights ahead.

Microsoft's Growth Engine is Firing on All Cylinders,Motley Fool,2 weeks ago,2020-11-19 20:26:12.858049,"But Apple's big growth opportunity, is services. How much do you guys think services was up for Apple in the most recent quarter? Brian Feroldi: 5%. Tim Beyers: ...",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/21/microsofts-growth-engine-is-firing-on-all-cylinder/,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a company reborn. Only a few years ago, the software giant was facing an uncertain future. Its formerly dominant operating system business was steadily losing relevance as modern computing moved away from the PC and into mobile, an area the company had never established a foothold in.

Fast forward to today, and Microsoft is back in the game. It's grown its market value to more than $1.6 trillion at recent prices.

On the Nov. 2 edition of ""The Wrap"" on Motley Fool Live, Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers walked ""The Wrap"" host Jason Hall and Motley Fool contributor Brian Feroldi through Microsoft's latest results, pointing out just how well the company is executing.

Tim Beyers: Right. Microsoft had its first quarter earnings report and this was last week. Let me just pull this up here because I want to pull up their release. But I think it was very strong and I think the thing that it gets glossed over, but it shouldn't, is that among the ones that are here domestically in the U.S. That's talking AWS, Microsoft Azure, and I don't know. Some people say Azure, I say Azure. I don't know. Abiomed.

Tim Beyers: BioMed, I have no idea. But here's a thing, of the three, Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS, who is the fastest-growing? Who continues to be the fastest-growing? Azure and they did it again. Let me just show this here.

Jason Hall: Wait. You mean Azure?

Tim Beyers: Yeah. There you go. Exactly right.

Brian Feroldi: Azure.

Tim Beyers: Yes or whatever. Do we even know? I don't know. So overall, Microsoft Azure was up 45% year-over-year. But here's the thing I want to show just in general. If you take a look across all the products, remember that this is a company that's well over a trillion dollars in market cap. This is growing very quickly. I just want to show some basic products and how fast these are growing. Server products up 21% in constant currency. Xbox content and services up 30% same year-over-year. Microsoft Surface, their hardware product in constant currency up 36% year-over-year.

Windows is -- granted -- you want to talk Windows and Windows OEM, installing Window machines that ship from somebody else, like Microsoft has a deal with say like Dell, and then Dell puts Windows on their machines and then they ship out those machines. So Microsoft gets some licensing fees. That used to be the biggest part of their business, down 5% year-over-year. That is largely, except for Bing, search advertising, everything else, except Office commercial products is double-digit growth. That is astounding.

Let me give you some perspective on this. So overall, in the latest quarter, Apple, killer business. We all know Apple is a great business. But Apple's big growth opportunity, is services. How much do you guys think services was up for Apple in the most recent quarter?

Brian Feroldi: 5%.

Tim Beyers: About 16%. It's definitely growth. Look at all these products. That's like basically matching LinkedIn, which Microsoft's like, ""Yeah. We got this thing."" My point here is that, Microsoft is really killing it. They're really killing it and I think that is underappreciated about how this company has structured a portfolio of products that has been very attractive for the customer base that's very sticky and they have this two layers. They have the Office products and the Windows products that provide an annuity cash flow stream, that Microsoft has proven really adept at reinvesting into high-growth opportunities, like Azure and they're killing it. I continue to believe that even though I say of the two, between Amazon and Microsoft, because if you split up Amazon today, and you split out AWS, I think Amazon would be a more valuable company. But in terms of business quality, I do not believe there is a better business in the world right now than Microsoft. Full stop.

Jason Hall: That's a powerful statement.

Tim Beyers: Full stop.

Jason Hall: That is a powerful statement.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.218, 'neu': 0.545, 'pos': 0.236, 'compound': 0.0516}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.413, 'pos': 0.587, 'compound': 0.7964}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.413, 'pos': 0.587, 'compound': 0.7964}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]",0.1991,0.0516,0.1991,0.14993333333333334,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive
Will Retail REITs Struggle or Thrive in 2021?,Motley Fool,2 weeks ago,2020-11-19 20:26:12.863477,"Apple, 6.5%, so Apple is three times bigger than all the REITs in the S&P 500.

The industry was already in the midst of a transition due to the growth of e-commerce before a pandemic brutalized the economy, and proved the final nail in the coffin for many retailers. While the S&P 500 has bounced back and delivered 13% in total returns since the beginning of the year, on strong gains by the tech sector, the S&P 1500 Retail REITs Index is still down more than 30%.

But the question many investors want answered is this: Is the worst behind us, or will retail REITs continue to struggle? On the Nov. 2 edition of ""The Wrap"" on Motley Fool Live, host Jason Hall engaged Motley Fool contributor Brian Feroldi and Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers to answer this exact question. And while all three think the worst is, broadly speaking, probably over, they have some differences in their expectations going forward.

Transcript:

Jason Hall: Pennsylvania Real Estate Trust (NYSE:PEI). I have to confess, this is one that I bought some of before, this was back in January or February. This is the largest mall owner in Philadelphia. It just filed for bankruptcy. Brian Feroldi, I'm going to get you to go first here. I want you to tell me, will retail REIT stocks, so these are the companies that own the property, will they finish 2021 higher or lower?

Brian Feroldi: Than they are right now, I assume.

Jason Hall: Than they are right now, and why.

Brian Feroldi: Higher, they're higher. They will finish higher because by the end of 2021, we will have a vaccine, good malls will attract back people, bad malls will die, as they should, or be converted into other usable space, but I think the devaluations are so compressed on these things. I'm going to pull it up while Tim's talking, but I'm pretty sure that REITs make up 2% of the S&P 500 right now, it's somewhere around there, two percent. Apple, 6.5%, so Apple is three times bigger than all the REITs in the S&P 500. I'm not saying that's wrong, but I think there's room for REITs to go higher from here, especially over the next year plus.

Jason Hall: Tim Beyers, what do you say?

Tim Beyers: I agree with that for a different reason. I'm just going to slightly modify what Brian said because he's right in that I believe it's a small portion of the market right now, and what you said about things being repurposed, I think that's the key. I don't think the malls come back in the same way, but I believe that there's so much movement in e-commerce and movement toward logistics and flexible workspace and things like that that there's a lot of repurposed property, these fixed malls [...] reimagined as distribution centers, as all sorts of stuff that I think we can creatively reengage that space, and I think we will.

So I expect it to be higher once we start reimagining. For example, I'll just say that I would find it fascinating but also not at all surprising if Amazon goes shopping in the mall space and starts figuring out like, we're going to have a distribution center here, here, here. They got a lot of cash, they have a lot of cash flow, I could absolutely see them doing that and maybe even just tying it close to where they have all those Kohl's. You go and you drop off your return at Kohl's, get that near an Amazon distribution center, you're just optimizing, optimizing, optimizing and, man, there's nobody better than Amazon at that. So I'm going to say higher for the repurposing.

Jason Hall: I agree. I think at this point the baby's been thrown out with the bathwater. I think the idea that the mall is going to completely go away is just as false as every piece of commercial real estate in Manhattan is going to be useless. I think that there's a lot of really extreme assumptions that are getting factored into a lot of things, so I tend to agree. I think, to both Tim and Brian's point, whether it's still serving the same purpose, that's definitely up for discussion. I think, in general, a lot of it is going to get repurposed.

I think the best companies out there that are owning large malls are in the best positions to negotiate with an Amazon. If you're Amazon, you want to talk to somebody that owns 300, 500 malls because then you can pick the 50 or 100 that best fit your need versus Pennsylvania Real Estate Trust that just owns malls in a very small geographically located area that don't give them access to the markets that they need. So it's going to be really interesting to see how it plays, but I tend to agree. I'll go so far as to say not only will they be higher, I think they're going to outperform the S&P 500 over the next two years, five years, maybe even the next 10 years. I think there's a lot of opportunity.",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.247, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.1967}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.1967}]",0.09835,-0.3182,0.09835,-0.040499999999999994,Neutral,Somewhat Positive,Negative,Somewhat Positive

Investors know that the key to profits is in the return – and that means, a willingness to shoulder risk. Risk is relative, of course, and tends to run hand-in-hand with the return potential. Find a stock with a giant return potential, and chances are, you’ve also found one with a higher risk profile. The highest returns usually come along with the lowest share prices. After all, when a stock is priced for just pennies, even a small gain in share price translates into a huge return. Which means that penny stocks – these days, usually seen as those equities priced under $5 – combine a perfect storm of market attractions: low share price, high return potential, and higher than usual risk. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up details on three compelling stocks that fit this profile of low share price and huge upside potential, 100% or more, according to Wall Street analysts. Cinedigm Corporation (CIDM)We’ll start with Cinedigm, the LA-based entertainment company specializing in content marketing and distribution along with digital cinema. Cinedigm is an independent studio for film, TV, and digital production. The company distributes digital media across a variety of content networks.Back in June, CIDM shares showed a sharp spike when the company announced its partnership with Vewd, the world’s largest OTT software provider for Smart TVs, a growing segment of the digital viewing world. Customers are shifting away from cable TV and more and more toward streaming. A working relationship with a Smart TV software company would give Cinedigm access to Vewd’s installed customer base – more than 300 million Smart TV sets. Revenues in 2020 have been fairly stable. For Q1, Q2, and Q3, the top line came in at $7.74 million, $6.02 million, and $7.18 million. The Q3 number holds the middle spot in that range. Earnings, however, missed expectations. At a 23-cent per share loss, the EPS came in 17-cents below expectations. On a positive note, CIDM reported a year-over-year sales increase in its core business of ad-based video on demand of 27%.Covering the stock for Benchmark, 5-star analyst Daniel Kurnos points out a few reasons why he thinks Cinedigm ""is becoming a much more intriguing investment proposition, particularly at these levels: 1) Organic growth is still building, with the legacy channel lineup strategy on pace to achieve the 30 channel milestone 12 months ahead of schedule; 2) A new highly accretive, streaming roll-up strategy is emerging that Cinedigm is in the best position to execute with minimal competition; 3) No credence or value is being given any more to Cinedigm’s digital projector inventory or Starrise stake, both of which should ultimately benefit in a post-COVID world.""In line with his bullish stance, Kurnos rates CIDM a Buy, and his $3.50 price target implies room for a stunning 573% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Kurnos’s track record, click here)Currently, CIDM has 2 reviews on record, making the stock a Moderate Buy. The shares are selling for 53 cents, and the $2.75 average price target suggests an impressive 418% upside on the one-year time horizon. (See CIDM stock analysis on TipRanks)Kubient (KBNT)Content distribution relies heavily on marketing and monetization for its profits, and that’s where Kubient comes in. This cloud software company offers an ad platform that connects publishers and marketing directly with their audiences. The company works with audience automation to collect data, connect brands, and create a transparent ad environment across digital channels.Kubient is a new company in the stock market, having held its IPO just this past August. The initial offering brought in $12.5 million gross, selling 2.5 million shares at $5 each. During those first few months of public trading, which included the end of the calendar third quarter, Kubient reported some solid Q3 revenue results. The top line rose from $92,000 in Q3 to $280,000. The year-over-year gain was even more impressive, reaching 400%.Maxim analyst Jack Vander Aarde believes that Kubient holds a strong position to bring real changes to its industry. The 5-star analyst writes of the company’s potential, “KBNT’s core offering, Audience Cloud, seeks to disrupt the $325B+ digital advertising market and address the industry’s current pain points. In 2019, advertisers lost ~$42B to ad fraud, which is forecast to grow into a $100B problem by 2023, but Kubient has a potential game-changing solution called KAI [...] We project 2021 revenue of $6.6M, up 211% y/y, and 2022 revenue of $17.4M, up 164% y/y. The business is highly scalable and should unlock significant operating leverage as revenue grows.”To this end, Vander Aarde rates KBNT a Buy along with a $10 price target. This figure suggests 154% upside growth from the current share price of $4. (To watch Vander Aarde’s track record, click here)Orion Group Holdings (ORN)The construction industry brings to mind home construction and hard hats putting up high rises, and that’s the usual experience most of us have. But Orion Group Holdings occupies a specialty niche in the industry, focusing on civil marine construction, industry, and commercial concrete. The company owns subsidiaries that each concentrate on a different niche, allowing them to hone their skills in some vital – even if less recognized – sectors of the construction world.The company’s share price through this year shows both its resilience and the importance of the construction industry to the economy. ORN shares fell sharply in mid-winter, when the coronavirus hit hard at the economy by forcing lockdown policies – but it has regained ground as the economy has reopened, and has recouped more than half of its losses from that time. Overall, however, ORN is still down ~20% year-to-date.Orion’s quarterly fiscal results also show the tale. The company registered a sequential loss in Q1, but has shown gains since then. For the calendar third quarter, ORN reported $189 million at the top line. EPS has performed even better this year, beating the forecast in Q1 when a loss was expected and the actual result was an 8-cent per share profit – and spiking to 23 cents per share, or 187% above the forecast, in Q3.In a positive development heading into the end of the year, in November Orion’s concrete segment won three major contracts in Texas. The projects are located in the Houston area, and total some $52 million.Noble analyst Poe Fratt feels that this stock has room for growth, and promises returns for investors. He writes, “[We] believe that the current stock price doesn't fairly reflect the ISG restructuring improvements and the positive outlook. A combination of above-average backlog, improved profitability, lower financial leverage and attractive valuation of 2.8x 2020E EBITDA and 2.4x 2021E EBITDA supports our view that the risk/reward profile remains compelling.”Fratt’s $8.25 price target implies a 101% upside for the year ahead. He rates the stock as Outperform (i.e. Buy). (To watch Fratt’s track record, click here)The two recent Buy ratings on ORN make the analyst consensus view a Moderate Buy. The average price target of $8.13 suggests a 100% growth potential for the next year. Shares are currently selling for $4.08.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has recorded 629 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours, the highest daily tally in about nine months.The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said Friday that 600 of the newly confirmed patients were domestically transmitted cases — nearly 80 % of them in the densely populous Seoul area, which has been at the centre of a recent viral resurgence.It says the 629 new cases took the country’s total to 36,332 for the pandemic, with 536 deaths related to COVID-19.After successfully suppressing two previous outbreaks this year, South Korea has been grappling with a fresh spike in infections since it relaxed stringent social distancing rules in October. Last week, it toughened distancing restrictions in the greater Seoul area and other places.___THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:— U.S. reaches daily records with more than 3,100 deaths and 100,000 hospitalizations; tops 200,000 daily cases— Russia vaccine available at 70 facilities in Moscow; hits record 28,145 daily cases— Getting vaccine to right people could change course of pandemic in U.S.— Britain is 5th nation to reach 60,000 coronavirus deaths— Facebook says it will remove misinformation about coronavirus vaccines___Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak___HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:DOVER, Del. — Delaware’s governor is issuing a stay-at-home advisory and implementing a universal mask mandate requiring people to wear cloth face coverings even in their own homes if someone outside the immediate household is present.Gov. John Carney on Thursday also recommended that schools suspend in-person instruction from Dec. 14 to Jan. 8 and resume hybrid learning on Jan. 11. Winter sports competitions will be prohibited during that period.The mask mandate will require all Delawareans to wear cloth face coverings anytime they are indoors with anyone outside their immediate household. Delaware has had a public mask mandate since April 28 requiring use of face coverings in public settings where social distancing is not possible.A spokesman for the governor says officials are relying on voluntary compliance with the mask mandate.___SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — Illinois public health officials have reported 10,959 newly confirmed coronavirus infections and a second consecutive day of near record deaths from COVID-19.The 192 fatalities announced Thursday matched the 24-hour toll reported May 13, at the height of the initial wave of the pandemic in Illinois. The number is second only to the 238 deaths reported Wednesday.Illinois has now reported 12,830 deaths among 759,562 coronavirus infections.___MONTREAL — The Quebec government is cancelling its plan to allow gatherings over four days of the Christmas holidays.Premier Francois Legault announced Thursday that the province will no longer permit multi-household gatherings of up to 10 people from Dec. 24 through Dec. 27 as had been planned.Legault first announced the Christmas plan on Nov. 19, saying people could get together as long as they quarantined for a week before and a week after the holiday period. But coronavirus infections, COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are on the rise and the province’s health system is deemed fragile due to a lack of staffing.Legault says it’s not realistic to think the numbers will go down sufficiently by Christmas.The French-speaking Canadian province reported 1,470 coronavirus cases Thursday.___PHILADELPHIA — Hospital beds are filling up and medical staffs are being stretched as Pennsylvania’s health care system copes with a growing number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients.State health officials say nearly half of all hospitals in the south-central region of the state and a third in the southwest anticipate staffing shortages within a week.Pennsylvania’s top health official said Thursday that modeling indicates the state will run out of intensive care beds this month. More than 85% of the state’s ICU beds are occupied now.But Dr. Rachel Levine added that she is even more concerned about hospital staffing. She notes that hospitals’ medical-surgical beds can be converted into ICU beds, but the supply of medical workers is “not infinite.”___RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina on Thursday reported its highest single-day increase in coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic, with more than 5,600 people testing positive for the coronavirus. The proportion of tests coming back positive has also risen sharply in recent days. On Sunday, the positivity rate surpassed 10% for the first time since April.And for the first time ever, more than 2,100 people are currently hospitalized due to COVID-19. On Wednesday, the state reported a daily increase of 82 deaths, which is the most since the start of the pandemic.At a time when all available metrics appear to show transmission at or near its worst levels yet, the state has shown strong reluctance to impose additional restrictions to help slow the spread.An executive order Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed last week included stronger language aimed at boosting enforcement of the statewide mask mandate. Ahead of Thanksgiving, he reduced indoor gatherings from a maximum of 25 people to 10 people.Cooper’s health secretary, Mandy Cohen, says an initial wave of nearly 85,000 Pfizer vaccine doses could arrive as early as Dec. 15.___SALT LAKE CITY — Gov. Gary Herbert says Utah plans to prioritize front-line health care workers after it receives its first round of coronavirus vaccine doses.They could arrive as early as mid-December. Hospital leaders say the first doses in Utah will go to front-line health care workers such as doctors and nurses in emergency departments.They will also be given to urgent care facilities and COVID-19 units as well as their housekeeping employees. Five hospitals that experienced the highest COVID-19 response will be first to receive doses.Each hospital is expecting to receive several thousand doses of Pfizer’s vaccine. Officials did not say how many doses each hospital will receive.___PORTLAND, Maine — An online portal designed to help Maine’s hospitality and tourism businesses obtain grants crashed on the day it was scheduled to start taking applications.The Portland Press Herald reports business owners reported problems with the portal after it opened at 9 a.m. on Thursday.The Maine Department of Economic and Community Development shut down the application less than two hours after it opened. The department says the portal will be open for applications again starting Friday morning.The tool allows businesses to apply for up to $20,000 in grants as part of a $40 million aid program announced by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills earlier in the week.___CARSON CITY, Nev. — Nevada reported 48 new deaths from the coronavirus on Thursday, marking the deadliest day since the onset of the pandemic as the state’s COVID-19 surge shows few signs of slowing and death totals peak throughout the U.S.Case and death totals continue to rise more than a week after new restrictions were implemented as part of Nevada’s statewide pause of activity.During the three-week period, the number of guests businesses can accept has been reduced to 25% of capacity.Hospitals continue to face strain and Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno is treating patients in an auxiliary unit in the parking garage.___PARIS — French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines will go to nursing homes residents when they will be available in the country, not before the end of the month.Castex presented on Thursday the country’s vaccination program for the 67-million inhabitants country.He said France already purchased “200 millions of doses, which represents 100 million people” since each vaccine requires two doses.Vaccines will be made available for free, he said. He reaffirmed vaccination won’t be mandatory.Health minister Olivier Veran said the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which is expected to arrive first, will go to nursing home residents and some staff working there who are more vulnerable due to their health condition.The vaccination campaign will then be gradually extended to the elderly and more fragile people, then to the whole population.France last week passed the milestone of 50,000 dead in the pandemic.___OKLAHOMA CITY — The first shipment of a coronavirus vaccine is expected in Oklahoma in about 10 days with health care workers and long term care providers and residents receiving the first doses, state health commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said Thursday.Frye said 33,000 doses of the vaccine developed by Pfizer is expected by Dec. 13 or 14 and a shipment of a second, required, dose is expected about three weeks later.The plan follows a draft distribution plan released by the health department in October and places first responders such as paramedics, police officers and firefighters in addition to the elderly and those at high risk in the second phase of people to receive the vaccine.School students teachers and staff are in the third phase of those to receive the vaccine, then the general public. The priority list was developed by a committee using guidelines provided by the federal Centers for Disease Control, Frye said.The seven-day rolling average of new cases in Oklahoma rose from 2,727 per day on Nov. 18 to 2,571 on Monday and the positivity increased from 15.8% to 16.34% during the same time, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. TThe state health department on Thursday reported an additional 1,707 virus cases and 24 more deaths for totals of 204,048 cases and 1,836 deaths since the pandemic began in March. There were 1,734 people hospitalized due to the virus.___LONDON — The United Kingdom has become the fifth country to officially record more than 60,000 coronavirus-related deaths.That news comes just three weeks after reaching 50,000. The British government reported another 414 deaths, taking the confirmed total to 60,113.The U.K, which has the highest virus-related death toll in Europe, joins the United States (274,000) Brazil (174,000), India (138,000) and Mexico (107,000) in reporting more than 60,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.The U.K.’s actual death toll is widely considered much higher because it only counts those who tested positive for the virus and doesn’t include those who died of COVID-19-related symptoms after 28 days.England lifted its lockdown Wednesday amid evidence that new cases are falling. However, restrictions remain in most parts of the country, along with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.___MILAN — Italy recorded a pandemic-high 993 deaths in the last 24 hours.That tops the previous high of 969 during the deadly peak in March. The number of new daily coronavirus cases reached 23,225 on Thursday, falling after three tiers of regional restrictions put in a month ago.Health officials say Italy’s rate of transmission has dropped below 1% nationally.The government is set to announce new restrictions for the holidays, including keeping ski areas closed and banning travel between regions from Dec. 21 through Jan. 6.Italy has registered 1.6 million confirmed coronavirus cases. The nation’s total death toll is 58,038, second in Europe after Britain.___WASHINGTON — Three former presidents say they’d publicly take a coronavirus vaccine, once one becomes available, to encourage all Americans to get inoculated.Barack Obama said during an episode Thursday of SiriusXM’s “The Joe Madison Show” that he may be filmed getting vaccinated, “just so that people know that I trust this science.”A spokesman for Bill Clinton suggested similar. George W. Bush’s chief of staff told CNN that Bush was ready to do similar. Those comments come as the coronavirus surges nationwide and even though potential vaccines may not be widely available for months.The coronavirus has killed more than 273,000 Americans and infected nearly 14 million people nationwide.___MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s president says he plans to give the military a role in distributing coronavirus vaccines, which he says U.S. President Donald Trump helped him get after a meeting in Washington in July.López Obrador suggested Mexico will wait until U.S. regulators approve the Pfizer vaccine later this month before giving it the go-ahead in Mexico.On Wednesday, Mexico’s Health Department signed a contract for 34.4 million doses and hopes to get 250,000 doses in December. Each person requires two doses.The president says the government is discussing with “the army and the navy, and we are defining the whole operation” to distribute the vaccine. López Obrador has given the military an unprecedented array of responsibilities in his two years in office, including distributing medical supplies and guarding hospitals.Mexico has registered 1.1 million confirmed cases and 107,500 confirmed deaths, the fourth-highest death toll in the world. However, there’s little testing and health officials estimate the actual death toll is likely closer to 150,000.The Associated Press",apple,aapl,"[{'neg': 0.254, 'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34}]","[{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': 0.3612}]","[{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': 0.3612}]",0.3612,-0.34,0.3612,0.12746666666666667,Somewhat Positive,Positive,Negative,Positive

Investors know that the key to profits is in the return – and that means, a willingness to shoulder risk. Risk is relative, of course, and tends to run hand-in-hand with the return potential. Find a stock with a giant return potential, and chances are, you’ve also found one with a higher risk profile. The highest returns usually come along with the lowest share prices. After all, when a stock is priced for just pennies, even a small gain in share price translates into a huge return. Which means that penny stocks – these days, usually seen as those equities priced under $5 – combine a perfect storm of market attractions: low share price, high return potential, and higher than usual risk. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up details on three compelling stocks that fit this profile of low share price and huge upside potential, 100% or more, according to Wall Street analysts. Cinedigm Corporation (CIDM)We’ll start with Cinedigm, the LA-based entertainment company specializing in content marketing and distribution along with digital cinema. Cinedigm is an independent studio for film, TV, and digital production. The company distributes digital media across a variety of content networks.Back in June, CIDM shares showed a sharp spike when the company announced its partnership with Vewd, the world’s largest OTT software provider for Smart TVs, a growing segment of the digital viewing world. Customers are shifting away from cable TV and more and more toward streaming. A working relationship with a Smart TV software company would give Cinedigm access to Vewd’s installed customer base – more than 300 million Smart TV sets. Revenues in 2020 have been fairly stable. For Q1, Q2, and Q3, the top line came in at $7.74 million, $6.02 million, and $7.18 million. The Q3 number holds the middle spot in that range. Earnings, however, missed expectations. At a 23-cent per share loss, the EPS came in 17-cents below expectations. On a positive note, CIDM reported a year-over-year sales increase in its core business of ad-based video on demand of 27%.Covering the stock for Benchmark, 5-star analyst Daniel Kurnos points out a few reasons why he thinks Cinedigm ""is becoming a much more intriguing investment proposition, particularly at these levels: 1) Organic growth is still building, with the legacy channel lineup strategy on pace to achieve the 30 channel milestone 12 months ahead of schedule; 2) A new highly accretive, streaming roll-up strategy is emerging that Cinedigm is in the best position to execute with minimal competition; 3) No credence or value is being given any more to Cinedigm’s digital projector inventory or Starrise stake, both of which should ultimately benefit in a post-COVID world.""In line with his bullish stance, Kurnos rates CIDM a Buy, and his $3.50 price target implies room for a stunning 573% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Kurnos’s track record, click here)Currently, CIDM has 2 reviews on record, making the stock a Moderate Buy. The shares are selling for 53 cents, and the $2.75 average price target suggests an impressive 418% upside on the one-year time horizon. (See CIDM stock analysis on TipRanks)Kubient (KBNT)Content distribution relies heavily on marketing and monetization for its profits, and that’s where Kubient comes in. This cloud software company offers an ad platform that connects publishers and marketing directly with their audiences. The company works with audience automation to collect data, connect brands, and create a transparent ad environment across digital channels.Kubient is a new company in the stock market, having held its IPO just this past August. The initial offering brought in $12.5 million gross, selling 2.5 million shares at $5 each. During those first few months of public trading, which included the end of the calendar third quarter, Kubient reported some solid Q3 revenue results. The top line rose from $92,000 in Q3 to $280,000. The year-over-year gain was even more impressive, reaching 400%.Maxim analyst Jack Vander Aarde believes that Kubient holds a strong position to bring real changes to its industry. The 5-star analyst writes of the company’s potential, “KBNT’s core offering, Audience Cloud, seeks to disrupt the $325B+ digital advertising market and address the industry’s current pain points. In 2019, advertisers lost ~$42B to ad fraud, which is forecast to grow into a $100B problem by 2023, but Kubient has a potential game-changing solution called KAI [...] We project 2021 revenue of $6.6M, up 211% y/y, and 2022 revenue of $17.4M, up 164% y/y. The business is highly scalable and should unlock significant operating leverage as revenue grows.”To this end, Vander Aarde rates KBNT a Buy along with a $10 price target. This figure suggests 154% upside growth from the current share price of $4. (To watch Vander Aarde’s track record, click here)Orion Group Holdings (ORN)The construction industry brings to mind home construction and hard hats putting up high rises, and that’s the usual experience most of us have. But Orion Group Holdings occupies a specialty niche in the industry, focusing on civil marine construction, industry, and commercial concrete. The company owns subsidiaries that each concentrate on a different niche, allowing them to hone their skills in some vital – even if less recognized – sectors of the construction world.The company’s share price through this year shows both its resilience and the importance of the construction industry to the economy. ORN shares fell sharply in mid-winter, when the coronavirus hit hard at the economy by forcing lockdown policies – but it has regained ground as the economy has reopened, and has recouped more than half of its losses from that time. Overall, however, ORN is still down ~20% year-to-date.Orion’s quarterly fiscal results also show the tale. The company registered a sequential loss in Q1, but has shown gains since then. For the calendar third quarter, ORN reported $189 million at the top line. EPS has performed even better this year, beating the forecast in Q1 when a loss was expected and the actual result was an 8-cent per share profit – and spiking to 23 cents per share, or 187% above the forecast, in Q3.In a positive development heading into the end of the year, in November Orion’s concrete segment won three major contracts in Texas. The projects are located in the Houston area, and total some $52 million.Noble analyst Poe Fratt feels that this stock has room for growth, and promises returns for investors. He writes, “[We] believe that the current stock price doesn't fairly reflect the ISG restructuring improvements and the positive outlook. A combination of above-average backlog, improved profitability, lower financial leverage and attractive valuation of 2.8x 2020E EBITDA and 2.4x 2021E EBITDA supports our view that the risk/reward profile remains compelling.”Fratt’s $8.25 price target implies a 101% upside for the year ahead. He rates the stock as Outperform (i.e. Buy). (To watch Fratt’s track record, click here)The two recent Buy ratings on ORN make the analyst consensus view a Moderate Buy. The average price target of $8.13 suggests a 100% growth potential for the next year. Shares are currently selling for $4.08.

Message from ManagementVirgilio Gibbon, Afya’s CEO, stated:“I hope that you and your families are continuing to stay safe and healthy. Although we are still in the midst of a pandemic, we have been able to successfully adapt to and navigate through the COVID related challenges and continue to deliver solid financial results. Our performance this quarter reflects the resilience of our students, faculty and team members. From the start of this pandemic, we had to adapt with the speed and agility needed to stay focused on providing the high-quality educational experience that our students had come to expect from us while at the same time executing on our long-term strategic plan. During the quarter, we strategically enhanced our business and completed several acquisitions to support our platform for future growth and to solidify our market position.I am pleased to report third quarter results, which were in line with expectations and the guidance we had provided. Earlier in the year, we had pivoted to leverage our online and virtual technology capabilities and adjust offerings for the Brazilian medical ecosystem. I am pleased that during the past quarter, across our medical schools, on site clinical classes are back. In turn, we were able to deliver H1 postponed classes and recognize the deferred revenue in the quarter. Additionally, our medical school maturation, successful integrations and execution, contributed to a 63% year over year increase in Adjusted EBITDA. Our liquidity was another highlight with a strong balance sheet to support acquisitions. We ended the quarter with R$1.1 billion in cash.Even during challenging times, we were able to execute our strategy. We acquired FCMPB and FESAR adding 277 medical seats during the quarter. Afya’s total medical students reached 9,567, a 50% increase over the same period of the prior year, with operating seats increasing 24% and approved seats 19% higher. Subsequent to quarter-end we announced the acquisition of UNIFIPMoc and Fip Guanambi, located in the states of Minas Gerais and Bahia, adding another 160 medical seats and putting us at 85% of our IPO three-year goal of 1,000 seats as a result of the 8 acquisitions accomplished since we become public last year. Importantly, our team continues to do an amazing job in integrating the acquired companies and generating synergies. The medical school industry remains highly fragmented, and we believe that the current environment is hastening the trends that favor larger, better capitalized companies. In turn, we have been very active in recent months with acquiring companies, pipeline development and continue to engage with a number of attractive targets in our core markets.At the same time, we remain committed to delivering innovation to our students, physicians and other health care professionals. COVID-19 has significantly accelerated demand for online/digital solutions and has sped up our strategies as well, including our move into digital. When we identified the critical need to find a virtual solution for our students, faculty and other health care professionals, we acted quickly and made our first acquisition in this area – PEBMED. We are continuously looking for ways to enhance our product and service offerings and in October we acquired iClinic, a practice management software company which includes services such as electronic medical records, clinical management system, telemedicine and a complete physicians’ marketplace that connects doctors and patients to schedule consultations. And, subsequent to quarter-end, we announced the acquisition of MedPhone, the number two medical App in Brazil behind WhiteBook – a PEBMED company. The integration of MedPhone’s clinical decision software with PEBMED will create significant synergy and allow us to offer both products through the same platform. Importantly, the founders of these acquired companies will join Afya’s management team and will be an integral part of the team driving our growth in the healthtech services.With these three acquisitions, Afya is taking another step to become the one stop shop for physicians in Brazil. Along with medical and health education courses and a clinical decisions app, we enter in a new segment that can help physicians manage their clinics and provide a better service to their patients. To date, we have over 200,000 health care professionals who use PEBMED, Medphone and iClinic. There are 500,000 doctors in Brazil, and our goal is to serve them all within our ecosystem.The investments that we have made in our technology platform enabled us to ensure that we were supporting our students, faculty and other health care professionals with what is so important to them, community and ease of access to critical data and information which is more critical now than ever and is also a key lever for both member acquisition and retention. We are seeing positive traction from our digital solutions. Additionally, our investments in digital are opening new business and revenue opportunities for us. Further, we expect demand for telehealth services to remain elevated over the long-term. As such, we are focused on further developing our existing digital capabilities to ensure the continued success of our students and other health care professionals. The iClinic acquisition was transformational for us, and we are still actively looking for other digital health transactions to strengthen Afya’s position in the market.I am proud to share with you that we have just refreshed our brand. After entering in all this new services offerings, we are the only complete medical education platform serving every stage of the doctor's career providing solutions and methodologies for a personalized experience. And when company awareness grows, its brand also does. We launched our new logo that reflects our DNA and will support gradually every service brand and local medical education institutions.I am also very pleased to share that Afya was ranked as the winner in the Education sector in the Época Negócios 360 survey. This award, which has been held annually for 7 years, is one of the most significant in the Communications industry and recognizes companies that are market leaders across six different categories including Financials, Corporate Governance & Sustainability, Vision and Human Resources. Considering that Afya is a very young company, we are very honored to be already be distinguished with this award. We also have won the Golden Tombstone in the Equity category.

Uniredentor average tuition fee for medical school in 9M2020 was R$ 9,625 and for UniSl was R$7,010. 2\. This number does not includes FCMPB and FESAR that had the closing of the operation in November, 2020 and contribute 277 seats to Afya. 3\. As Medcel and Ipemed were acquired on March 31, 2019 and on May 9, 2019 respectively, revenue from courses for BU2 were not accounted for in 1Q19. The number of students is disclosed to contribute with investors analysis. Along with the active paying students, 10,052 medical students from public and private medical schools are still accessing the Company’s Digital platform with a temporary free access during the pandemic crisis.MaU represents the number of unique individuals that consumed Afya’s digital content in the last 30 days. Total monthly active users (MaU) were 165,035 in the new PEBMED app. Considering only the MaU of Medcel, the user base decreased 10.3% due to COVID related courses that were offered in the 2Q20, which temporarily inflated MaU in that quarter. Afya’s offers to its MaU a significant amount of learning assets, comprised of e-books, videos, podcasts and question/answer documents.Table 3: Key Operational Drivers for BU2Third Quarter 3Q202Q20% Chg 1Q20 Total Monthly Active Users (MaU) - Medcel18,32220,420-10.3% 16,008 Total Monthly Active Users (MaU) - PEBMED165,035-- - Seasonality Afya’s two businesses are impacted by seasonality but at different time periods. The first is associated with the concentration of prep course revenues in the first and fourth quarters of each year, when new content (books and e-books) is delivered and the majority of the revenues are recognized. The second is associated with the maturation of several medical schools, which leads to a higher enrollment base in the second half of each year. As a result, in a typical year, the first quarter is normally the strongest. The fourth quarter is typically the second strongest, followed by the third and second quarters, respectively. Finally, the second half of the year is normally stronger than the first half.However, this year, due to the revenue postponement caused by Covid crisis, the Company is expected to see a smoother seasonality between the third and fourth quarters.RevenueTotal Net Revenue for third quarter 2020 was R$309.4 million, an increase of 49.7% over the same period of prior year. Revenue in the quarter partially benefitted from the recognition of revenue that had been deferred earlier in the year due to the postponement of on-campus activities as some practical educational activities having to be re-scheduled to 3Q20 due to impacts from COVID-19. This amounted to R$14.4 million. Adjusted Net Revenue in 3Q20, which includes the impact of R$3.9 million due to temporary discounts in tuition fees granted by state decrees and individual and collective legal proceedings related to COVID 19 was R$313.3 million. Excluding UniSL, UniRedentor and PEBMED, Adjusted Net Revenue in third quarter increased 15.7% YoY to R$239.1 million.For the nine-months ended September 30, 2020 Total Net Revenue was R$855.9 million, which increased 61.6% over the same period of last year. 9M20 Pro Forma Adjusted Net Revenue was R$859.8 million.

Balance Sheet and Cash FlowCash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, at September 30, 2020 were R$1.1 billion, in line with the cash position in June 30, 2020.For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, Afya reported an Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations of R$324.7 million up from R$234.7 million in same period of previous year, a 38.4% year-over-year increase.Operating Cash Conversion Ratio for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 was 85.6% compared with 109.2% in same period of the previous year. This decrease was mainly due to the consolidation of Medcel results this year, students renegotiation of overdue monthly installments due to Covid-19 crisis and less advances from students.As Prep course’s revenues are recognized mainly in the first and fourth quarters of each year, but the receivables are mostly stable during the year, Medcel’s results negatively affects cash conversion in the first and fourth quarters.Table 6: Operating Cash Conversion Ratio ReconciliationFor the nine months period ended September 30, (in thousand of R$)Considering the adoption of IFRS 16 2020 2019 % Chg (a) Cash flow from operations308,916 230,647 33.9% (b) Income taxes paid15,830 4,033 292.5% (c) = (a) + (b) Adjusted cash flow from operations324,746 234,680 38.4% (d) Adjusted EBITDA408,066 230,915 76.7% (e) Non-recurring expenses: \- Integration of new companies (1)7,743 4,500 72.1% \- M&A advisory and due diligence (2)9,345 1,388 573.3% \- Expansion projects (3)2,886 1,411 104.5% \- Restructuring Expenses (4)4,863 8,759 -44.5% \- Mandatory Discounts in Tuition Fees (5)3,914 - n.a.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board—IASB, Afya uses Proforma Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted Net Income and Operating Cash Conversion Ratio information for the convenience of investors, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purpose to measure financial performance but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measure.Afya calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus/minus net financial result plus income taxes expense plus depreciation and amortization plus interest received on late payments of monthly tuition fees, plus share-based compensation plus/minus income share associate plus/minus non-recurring expenses. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as pro forma net income plus/minus pro forma net financial result plus pro forma income taxes expense plus pro forma depreciation and amortization plus pro forma interest received on late payments of monthly tuition fees, plus pro forma share-based compensation plus/minus pro forma income share associate plus/minus pro forma non-recurring expenses. The calculation for Adjusted Net Income is net income plus amortization of customer relationships and trademark, plus shared based compensation. We calculate Operating Cash Conversion Ratio as the cash flows from operations, adjusted with income taxes paid divided by Adjusted EBITDA plus/minus non-recurring expenses.Management presents Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Net Income because it believes these measures provide investors with a supplemental measure of the financial performance of the core operations that facilitates period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Afya also presents Operating Cash Conversion Ratio because it believes this measure provides investors with a measure of how efficiently the Company converts EBITDA into cash. The non-GAAP financial measures described in this prospectus are not a substitute for the IFRS measures of earnings. Additionally, calculations of Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted Net Income and Operating Cash Conversion Ratio may be different from the calculations used by other companies, including competitors in the education services industry, and therefore, Afya’s measures may not be comparable to those of other companies.8. Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information The unaudited interim pro forma condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 is based on the historical unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of each company, and gives effect of the acquisition of Medcel, IPEMED and FASA by Afya Brazil as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2019.

Investors know that the key to profits is in the return – and that means, a willingness to shoulder risk. Risk is relative, of course, and tends to run hand-in-hand with the return potential. Find a stock with a giant return potential, and chances are, you’ve also found one with a higher risk profile. The highest returns usually come along with the lowest share prices. After all, when a stock is priced for just pennies, even a small gain in share price translates into a huge return. Which means that penny stocks – these days, usually seen as those equities priced under $5 – combine a perfect storm of market attractions: low share price, high return potential, and higher than usual risk. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up details on three compelling stocks that fit this profile of low share price and huge upside potential, 100% or more, according to Wall Street analysts. Cinedigm Corporation (CIDM)We’ll start with Cinedigm, the LA-based entertainment company specializing in content marketing and distribution along with digital cinema. Cinedigm is an independent studio for film, TV, and digital production. The company distributes digital media across a variety of content networks.Back in June, CIDM shares showed a sharp spike when the company announced its partnership with Vewd, the world’s largest OTT software provider for Smart TVs, a growing segment of the digital viewing world. Customers are shifting away from cable TV and more and more toward streaming. A working relationship with a Smart TV software company would give Cinedigm access to Vewd’s installed customer base – more than 300 million Smart TV sets. Revenues in 2020 have been fairly stable. For Q1, Q2, and Q3, the top line came in at $7.74 million, $6.02 million, and $7.18 million. The Q3 number holds the middle spot in that range. Earnings, however, missed expectations. At a 23-cent per share loss, the EPS came in 17-cents below expectations. On a positive note, CIDM reported a year-over-year sales increase in its core business of ad-based video on demand of 27%.Covering the stock for Benchmark, 5-star analyst Daniel Kurnos points out a few reasons why he thinks Cinedigm ""is becoming a much more intriguing investment proposition, particularly at these levels: 1) Organic growth is still building, with the legacy channel lineup strategy on pace to achieve the 30 channel milestone 12 months ahead of schedule; 2) A new highly accretive, streaming roll-up strategy is emerging that Cinedigm is in the best position to execute with minimal competition; 3) No credence or value is being given any more to Cinedigm’s digital projector inventory or Starrise stake, both of which should ultimately benefit in a post-COVID world.""In line with his bullish stance, Kurnos rates CIDM a Buy, and his $3.50 price target implies room for a stunning 573% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Kurnos’s track record, click here)Currently, CIDM has 2 reviews on record, making the stock a Moderate Buy. The shares are selling for 53 cents, and the $2.75 average price target suggests an impressive 418% upside on the one-year time horizon. (See CIDM stock analysis on TipRanks)Kubient (KBNT)Content distribution relies heavily on marketing and monetization for its profits, and that’s where Kubient comes in. This cloud software company offers an ad platform that connects publishers and marketing directly with their audiences. The company works with audience automation to collect data, connect brands, and create a transparent ad environment across digital channels.Kubient is a new company in the stock market, having held its IPO just this past August. The initial offering brought in $12.5 million gross, selling 2.5 million shares at $5 each. During those first few months of public trading, which included the end of the calendar third quarter, Kubient reported some solid Q3 revenue results. The top line rose from $92,000 in Q3 to $280,000. The year-over-year gain was even more impressive, reaching 400%.Maxim analyst Jack Vander Aarde believes that Kubient holds a strong position to bring real changes to its industry. The 5-star analyst writes of the company’s potential, “KBNT’s core offering, Audience Cloud, seeks to disrupt the $325B+ digital advertising market and address the industry’s current pain points. In 2019, advertisers lost ~$42B to ad fraud, which is forecast to grow into a $100B problem by 2023, but Kubient has a potential game-changing solution called KAI [...] We project 2021 revenue of $6.6M, up 211% y/y, and 2022 revenue of $17.4M, up 164% y/y. The business is highly scalable and should unlock significant operating leverage as revenue grows.”To this end, Vander Aarde rates KBNT a Buy along with a $10 price target. This figure suggests 154% upside growth from the current share price of $4. (To watch Vander Aarde’s track record, click here)Orion Group Holdings (ORN)The construction industry brings to mind home construction and hard hats putting up high rises, and that’s the usual experience most of us have. But Orion Group Holdings occupies a specialty niche in the industry, focusing on civil marine construction, industry, and commercial concrete. The company owns subsidiaries that each concentrate on a different niche, allowing them to hone their skills in some vital – even if less recognized – sectors of the construction world.The company’s share price through this year shows both its resilience and the importance of the construction industry to the economy. ORN shares fell sharply in mid-winter, when the coronavirus hit hard at the economy by forcing lockdown policies – but it has regained ground as the economy has reopened, and has recouped more than half of its losses from that time. Overall, however, ORN is still down ~20% year-to-date.Orion’s quarterly fiscal results also show the tale. The company registered a sequential loss in Q1, but has shown gains since then. For the calendar third quarter, ORN reported $189 million at the top line. EPS has performed even better this year, beating the forecast in Q1 when a loss was expected and the actual result was an 8-cent per share profit – and spiking to 23 cents per share, or 187% above the forecast, in Q3.In a positive development heading into the end of the year, in November Orion’s concrete segment won three major contracts in Texas. The projects are located in the Houston area, and total some $52 million.Noble analyst Poe Fratt feels that this stock has room for growth, and promises returns for investors. He writes, “[We] believe that the current stock price doesn't fairly reflect the ISG restructuring improvements and the positive outlook. A combination of above-average backlog, improved profitability, lower financial leverage and attractive valuation of 2.8x 2020E EBITDA and 2.4x 2021E EBITDA supports our view that the risk/reward profile remains compelling.”Fratt’s $8.25 price target implies a 101% upside for the year ahead. He rates the stock as Outperform (i.e. Buy). (To watch Fratt’s track record, click here)The two recent Buy ratings on ORN make the analyst consensus view a Moderate Buy. The average price target of $8.13 suggests a 100% growth potential for the next year. Shares are currently selling for $4.08.

Investors know that the key to profits is in the return – and that means, a willingness to shoulder risk. Risk is relative, of course, and tends to run hand-in-hand with the return potential. Find a stock with a giant return potential, and chances are, you’ve also found one with a higher risk profile. The highest returns usually come along with the lowest share prices. After all, when a stock is priced for just pennies, even a small gain in share price translates into a huge return. Which means that penny stocks – these days, usually seen as those equities priced under $5 – combine a perfect storm of market attractions: low share price, high return potential, and higher than usual risk. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up details on three compelling stocks that fit this profile of low share price and huge upside potential, 100% or more, according to Wall Street analysts. Cinedigm Corporation (CIDM)We’ll start with Cinedigm, the LA-based entertainment company specializing in content marketing and distribution along with digital cinema. Cinedigm is an independent studio for film, TV, and digital production. The company distributes digital media across a variety of content networks.Back in June, CIDM shares showed a sharp spike when the company announced its partnership with Vewd, the world’s largest OTT software provider for Smart TVs, a growing segment of the digital viewing world. Customers are shifting away from cable TV and more and more toward streaming. A working relationship with a Smart TV software company would give Cinedigm access to Vewd’s installed customer base – more than 300 million Smart TV sets. Revenues in 2020 have been fairly stable. For Q1, Q2, and Q3, the top line came in at $7.74 million, $6.02 million, and $7.18 million. The Q3 number holds the middle spot in that range. Earnings, however, missed expectations. At a 23-cent per share loss, the EPS came in 17-cents below expectations. On a positive note, CIDM reported a year-over-year sales increase in its core business of ad-based video on demand of 27%.Covering the stock for Benchmark, 5-star analyst Daniel Kurnos points out a few reasons why he thinks Cinedigm ""is becoming a much more intriguing investment proposition, particularly at these levels: 1) Organic growth is still building, with the legacy channel lineup strategy on pace to achieve the 30 channel milestone 12 months ahead of schedule; 2) A new highly accretive, streaming roll-up strategy is emerging that Cinedigm is in the best position to execute with minimal competition; 3) No credence or value is being given any more to Cinedigm’s digital projector inventory or Starrise stake, both of which should ultimately benefit in a post-COVID world.""In line with his bullish stance, Kurnos rates CIDM a Buy, and his $3.50 price target implies room for a stunning 573% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Kurnos’s track record, click here)Currently, CIDM has 2 reviews on record, making the stock a Moderate Buy. The shares are selling for 53 cents, and the $2.75 average price target suggests an impressive 418% upside on the one-year time horizon. (See CIDM stock analysis on TipRanks)Kubient (KBNT)Content distribution relies heavily on marketing and monetization for its profits, and that’s where Kubient comes in. This cloud software company offers an ad platform that connects publishers and marketing directly with their audiences. The company works with audience automation to collect data, connect brands, and create a transparent ad environment across digital channels.Kubient is a new company in the stock market, having held its IPO just this past August. The initial offering brought in $12.5 million gross, selling 2.5 million shares at $5 each. During those first few months of public trading, which included the end of the calendar third quarter, Kubient reported some solid Q3 revenue results. The top line rose from $92,000 in Q3 to $280,000. The year-over-year gain was even more impressive, reaching 400%.Maxim analyst Jack Vander Aarde believes that Kubient holds a strong position to bring real changes to its industry. The 5-star analyst writes of the company’s potential, “KBNT’s core offering, Audience Cloud, seeks to disrupt the $325B+ digital advertising market and address the industry’s current pain points. In 2019, advertisers lost ~$42B to ad fraud, which is forecast to grow into a $100B problem by 2023, but Kubient has a potential game-changing solution called KAI [...] We project 2021 revenue of $6.6M, up 211% y/y, and 2022 revenue of $17.4M, up 164% y/y. The business is highly scalable and should unlock significant operating leverage as revenue grows.”To this end, Vander Aarde rates KBNT a Buy along with a $10 price target. This figure suggests 154% upside growth from the current share price of $4. (To watch Vander Aarde’s track record, click here)Orion Group Holdings (ORN)The construction industry brings to mind home construction and hard hats putting up high rises, and that’s the usual experience most of us have. But Orion Group Holdings occupies a specialty niche in the industry, focusing on civil marine construction, industry, and commercial concrete. The company owns subsidiaries that each concentrate on a different niche, allowing them to hone their skills in some vital – even if less recognized – sectors of the construction world.The company’s share price through this year shows both its resilience and the importance of the construction industry to the economy. ORN shares fell sharply in mid-winter, when the coronavirus hit hard at the economy by forcing lockdown policies – but it has regained ground as the economy has reopened, and has recouped more than half of its losses from that time. Overall, however, ORN is still down ~20% year-to-date.Orion’s quarterly fiscal results also show the tale. The company registered a sequential loss in Q1, but has shown gains since then. For the calendar third quarter, ORN reported $189 million at the top line. EPS has performed even better this year, beating the forecast in Q1 when a loss was expected and the actual result was an 8-cent per share profit – and spiking to 23 cents per share, or 187% above the forecast, in Q3.In a positive development heading into the end of the year, in November Orion’s concrete segment won three major contracts in Texas. The projects are located in the Houston area, and total some $52 million.Noble analyst Poe Fratt feels that this stock has room for growth, and promises returns for investors. He writes, “[We] believe that the current stock price doesn't fairly reflect the ISG restructuring improvements and the positive outlook. A combination of above-average backlog, improved profitability, lower financial leverage and attractive valuation of 2.8x 2020E EBITDA and 2.4x 2021E EBITDA supports our view that the risk/reward profile remains compelling.”Fratt’s $8.25 price target implies a 101% upside for the year ahead. He rates the stock as Outperform (i.e. Buy). (To watch Fratt’s track record, click here)The two recent Buy ratings on ORN make the analyst consensus view a Moderate Buy. The average price target of $8.13 suggests a 100% growth potential for the next year. Shares are currently selling for $4.08.

For Q1, Q2, and Q3, the top line came in at $7.74 million, $6.02 million, and $7.18 million. The Q3 number holds the middle spot in that range. Earnings, however, missed expectations. At a 23-cent per share loss, the EPS came in 17-cents below expectations. On a positive note, CIDM reported a year-over-year sales increase in its core business of ad-based video on demand of 27%.Covering the stock for Benchmark, 5-star analyst Daniel Kurnos points out a few reasons why he thinks Cinedigm ""is becoming a much more intriguing investment proposition, particularly at these levels: 1) Organic growth is still building, with the legacy channel lineup strategy on pace to achieve the 30 channel milestone 12 months ahead of schedule; 2) A new highly accretive, streaming roll-up strategy is emerging that Cinedigm is in the best position to execute with minimal competition; 3) No credence or value is being given any more to Cinedigm’s digital projector inventory or Starrise stake, both of which should ultimately benefit in a post-COVID world.""In line with his bullish stance, Kurnos rates CIDM a Buy, and his $3.50 price target implies room for a stunning 573% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Kurnos’s track record, click here)Currently, CIDM has 2 reviews on record, making the stock a Moderate Buy. The shares are selling for 53 cents, and the $2.75 average price target suggests an impressive 418% upside on the one-year time horizon. (See CIDM stock analysis on TipRanks)Kubient (KBNT)Content distribution relies heavily on marketing and monetization for its profits, and that’s where Kubient comes in. This cloud software company offers an ad platform that connects publishers and marketing directly with their audiences. The company works with audience automation to collect data, connect brands, and create a transparent ad environment across digital channels.Kubient is a new company in the stock market, having held its IPO just this past August. The initial offering brought in $12.5 million gross, selling 2.5 million shares at $5 each. During those first few months of public trading, which included the end of the calendar third quarter, Kubient reported some solid Q3 revenue results. The top line rose from $92,000 in Q3 to $280,000. The year-over-year gain was even more impressive, reaching 400%.Maxim analyst Jack Vander Aarde believes that Kubient holds a strong position to bring real changes to its industry. The 5-star analyst writes of the company’s potential, “KBNT’s core offering, Audience Cloud, seeks to disrupt the $325B+ digital advertising market and address the industry’s current pain points. In 2019, advertisers lost ~$42B to ad fraud, which is forecast to grow into a $100B problem by 2023, but Kubient has a potential game-changing solution called KAI [...] We project 2021 revenue of $6.6M, up 211% y/y, and 2022 revenue of $17.4M, up 164% y/y. The business is highly scalable and should unlock significant operating leverage as revenue grows.”To this end, Vander Aarde rates KBNT a Buy along with a $10 price target. This figure suggests 154% upside growth from the current share price of $4.

But Orion Group Holdings occupies a specialty niche in the industry, focusing on civil marine construction, industry, and commercial concrete. The company owns subsidiaries that each concentrate on a different niche, allowing them to hone their skills in some vital – even if less recognized – sectors of the construction world.The company’s share price through this year shows both its resilience and the importance of the construction industry to the economy. ORN shares fell sharply in mid-winter, when the coronavirus hit hard at the economy by forcing lockdown policies – but it has regained ground as the economy has reopened, and has recouped more than half of its losses from that time. Overall, however, ORN is still down ~20% year-to-date.Orion’s quarterly fiscal results also show the tale. The company registered a sequential loss in Q1, but has shown gains since then. For the calendar third quarter, ORN reported $189 million at the top line. EPS has performed even better this year, beating the forecast in Q1 when a loss was expected and the actual result was an 8-cent per share profit – and spiking to 23 cents per share, or 187% above the forecast, in Q3.In a positive development heading into the end of the year, in November Orion’s concrete segment won three major contracts in Texas. The projects are located in the Houston area, and total some $52 million.Noble analyst Poe Fratt feels that this stock has room for growth, and promises returns for investors.

Investors know that the key to profits is in the return – and that means, a willingness to shoulder risk. Risk is relative, of course, and tends to run hand-in-hand with the return potential. Find a stock with a giant return potential, and chances are, you’ve also found one with a higher risk profile. The highest returns usually come along with the lowest share prices. After all, when a stock is priced for just pennies, even a small gain in share price translates into a huge return. Which means that penny stocks – these days, usually seen as those equities priced under $5 – combine a perfect storm of market attractions: low share price, high return potential, and higher than usual risk. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up details on three compelling stocks that fit this profile of low share price and huge upside potential, 100% or more, according to Wall Street analysts. Cinedigm Corporation (CIDM)We’ll start with Cinedigm, the LA-based entertainment company specializing in content marketing and distribution along with digital cinema. Cinedigm is an independent studio for film, TV, and digital production. The company distributes digital media across a variety of content networks.Back in June, CIDM shares showed a sharp spike when the company announced its partnership with Vewd, the world’s largest OTT software provider for Smart TVs, a growing segment of the digital viewing world. Customers are shifting away from cable TV and more and more toward streaming. A working relationship with a Smart TV software company would give Cinedigm access to Vewd’s installed customer base – more than 300 million Smart TV sets. Revenues in 2020 have been fairly stable. For Q1, Q2, and Q3, the top line came in at $7.74 million, $6.02 million, and $7.18 million. The Q3 number holds the middle spot in that range. Earnings, however, missed expectations.

It’s not only in tech that valuation look toppy. If we use enterprise value (market capitalization plus net debt) to sales (EV/S) as our primary indicator, the number of extraordinarily high-priced companies in the Russell 1000 is approaching record levels (first chart, below), while it’s at an all-time high in MSCI World (second chart, below).

As stocks are so expensive, it’s a good time to ask how they’ve performed historically. The answer, in short: Not well — but not as badly as one might expect. And that is partially driven by long-term positive skewness in returns, where a few successes can offset many losers.

For stocks in the Russell 1000 (MSCI World) whose EV/S exceeds 10 for the first time, the median underperformance is 65% (33%) cumulatively over the next five years. The mean outcome is a bit better — reflecting that positive skewness — with underperformance of 28% and 7%, respectively, for the Russell 1000 and MSCI World.

However, if we look at even more extremely valued companies, using 20 times as our threshold (and such companies do exist today!), the prospects look dimmer. In the Russell 1000 (MSCI World), cumulative relative underperformance averages 42% (22%). The median cumulative underperformance is 73% (50%)! While it may not be totally fair to say these companies are un-investable, historically the odds have been stacked against them.

Historical record

Is it different this time?

To those happy holders of stocks trading at egregiously high multiples, there are two material differences between the markets of 2020 and those of history: First, the risk-free rate is currently close to zero in developed markets, and, in theory, a company with accelerating growth at a zero discount rate has no upper bound on its valuation. Second, it is clear that return on capital for the best cohort of companies — the FAANGMs, for instance — has entered a new paradigm in terms of the potential for persistence at a higher plateau. (FAANGM is an acronym for Facebook FB, -1.97% , Apple AAPL, -0.11% , Amazon AMZN, -0.52% , Netflix NFLX, -1.16% , Google holding company Alphabet GOOG, -0.06% GOOGL, -0.17% and Microsoft MSFT, -0.52% . )

As far as return on equity (ROE) goes, the median company in the top decile of the Russell 1000 (excluding financials and real estate) makes 44%. Assuming growth of 5% in perpetuity (not an ungenerous assumption), and a cost of equity of 6% (long bonds plus a 5%-ish equity risk premium, again in perpetuity) the Gordon Growth Model suggests a warranted price-to-book multiple of 39 times.

At first blush, very high ROEs and low discount rates do seem to justify eye-watering valuations. But this conclusion rests on the assumption that the current cohort of the most expensive stocks are also the most profitable. And this is manifestly not the case, as the chart below shows. The median ROE for the cohort of Russell 1000 stocks with an EV/Sales greater than 10 has been no better than zero on average since 1999. And for EV/sales greater than 20, ROE has been materially more negative over time.

The picture for MSCI World is broadly comparable, as the chart below shows.

More unfortunately still, the median ROE for the five years after crossing the 10 and 20 times sales thresholds doesn’t improve at all for either Russell 1000 or MSCI World, meaning that nothing in history supports the idea that today’s absurdly expensive stocks become tomorrow’s global leaders, at least as far as returns on capital goes.

New paradigm

When an investor is paying 10, 20 or more in terms of sales, there is the expectation of significant future growth. With ultra-low interest rates and persistently high returns on capital for a significant number of companies, and particularly given the high-profile success stories of the FAANGM stocks, it can appear at first glance that we have indeed entered a new paradigm.

Looking back over history presents a very different story. Indeed, the exception of the FAANGM stocks appears to mask a more powerful and persistent truth: Stocks valued at excessively high levels rarely deliver earnings to justify these inflated prices.

It feels unfashionable in the age of the unicorn to suggest that the valuation techniques we learned in school still hold water. But a close analysis of historical precedent presents us with precisely these lessons, and we urge long-term investors to think hard before launching into the frantic scramble to uncover the next FAANGM miracle stock.

As stocks are so expensive, it’s a good time to ask how they’ve performed historically. The answer, in short: Not well — but not as badly as one might expect. And that is partially driven by long-term positive skewness in returns, where a few successes can offset many losers.

For stocks in the Russell 1000 (MSCI World) whose EV/S exceeds 10 for the first time, the median underperformance is 65% (33%) cumulatively over the next five years. The mean outcome is a bit better — reflecting that positive skewness — with underperformance of 28% and 7%, respectively, for the Russell 1000 and MSCI World.

However, if we look at even more extremely valued companies, using 20 times as our threshold (and such companies do exist today!), the prospects look dimmer. In the Russell 1000 (MSCI World), cumulative relative underperformance averages 42% (22%). The median cumulative underperformance is 73% (50%)! While it may not be totally fair to say these companies are un-investable, historically the odds have been stacked against them.

Historical record

Is it different this time?

To those happy holders of stocks trading at egregiously high multiples, there are two material differences between the markets of 2020 and those of history: First, the risk-free rate is currently close to zero in developed markets, and, in theory, a company with accelerating growth at a zero discount rate has no upper bound on its valuation. Second, it is clear that return on capital for the best cohort of companies — the FAANGMs, for instance — has entered a new paradigm in terms of the potential for persistence at a higher plateau. (FAANGM is an acronym for Facebook FB, -1.97% , Apple AAPL, -0.11% , Amazon AMZN, -0.52% , Netflix NFLX, -1.16% , Google holding company Alphabet GOOG, -0.06% GOOGL, -0.17% and Microsoft MSFT, -0.52% . )

As far as return on equity (ROE) goes, the median company in the top decile of the Russell 1000 (excluding financials and real estate) makes 44%. Assuming growth of 5% in perpetuity (not an ungenerous assumption), and a cost of equity of 6% (long bonds plus a 5%-ish equity risk premium, again in perpetuity) the Gordon Growth Model suggests a warranted price-to-book multiple of 39 times.

At first blush, very high ROEs and low discount rates do seem to justify eye-watering valuations. But this conclusion rests on the assumption that the current cohort of the most expensive stocks are also the most profitable. And this is manifestly not the case, as the chart below shows. The median ROE for the cohort of Russell 1000 stocks with an EV/Sales greater than 10 has been no better than zero on average since 1999. And for EV/sales greater than 20, ROE has been materially more negative over time.

The picture for MSCI World is broadly comparable, as the chart below shows.

More unfortunately still, the median ROE for the five years after crossing the 10 and 20 times sales thresholds doesn’t improve at all for either Russell 1000 or MSCI World, meaning that nothing in history supports the idea that today’s absurdly expensive stocks become tomorrow’s global leaders, at least as far as returns on capital goes.

New paradigm

When an investor is paying 10, 20 or more in terms of sales, there is the expectation of significant future growth. With ultra-low interest rates and persistently high returns on capital for a significant number of companies, and particularly given the high-profile success stories of the FAANGM stocks, it can appear at first glance that we have indeed entered a new paradigm.

Looking back over history presents a very different story. Indeed, the exception of the FAANGM stocks appears to mask a more powerful and persistent truth: Stocks valued at excessively high levels rarely deliver earnings to justify these inflated prices.

It feels unfashionable in the age of the unicorn to suggest that the valuation techniques we learned in school still hold water. But a close analysis of historical precedent presents us with precisely these lessons, and we urge long-term investors to think hard before launching into the frantic scramble to uncover the next FAANGM miracle stock.

Many of the companies that have come through for investors in a major way in 2020 will continue to pad those gains in the year ahead.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) have delivered big share price gains lately, but the best could be yet to come. Let's go over why these three recent winners can keep the good times rolling in 2021 for that $2,000 that you've been hoping to invest in the market.

NVIDIA

The semiconductor pioneer bounced back in a major way in 2020. NVIDIA shares are up 122% through Friday's close, and the news keeps getting better. Growth is accelerating, its co-founder CEO is killing it on all fronts, and the company is positioned perfectly to cash in on the booms in gaming, data centers, and all of the cool applications where artificial intelligence is pitching a tent these days.

It's easy to wonder if the stock has overrun its fundamentals, but now is a good time to point out that NVIDIA is bouncing off a crummy 2019. Revenue declined for four consecutive quarters, but it has rebounded with four straight reports of quarterly top-line growth of 38% or better. This week's report was the heartiest of the streak, as NVIDIA checked in with 57% and 66% growth in revenue and adjusted earnings, respectively.

CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is doing right by everybody. Employees love him, going by his nearly perfect 99% approval rating on employee reviews site Glassdoor. Developers and clients have grown fond of the Kitchen Keynote speeches he has been delivering from his own kitchen throughout the pandemic. Shareholders obviously aren't complaining.

DraftKings

One of this year's hottest debutantes is DraftKings, which has more than doubled since April, when it debuted on the market by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The leader in wagering on fantasy sports and a rising star in the online sportsbook market, it has impressed investors in its first two quarters as a public company.

Revenue rose 24% for the second quarter, an amazing feat since most of the pro sports leagues didn't get started again until later in the summer. This week, we saw DraftKings come through with 42% in adjusted top-line growth for the third quarter, raising its guidance for all of 2020 in the process.

DraftKings now forecasts $540 million to $560 million in revenue this year, or 25% to 30% in pro forma growth. It initiated its guidance for 2021, and the midpoint of the $750 million to $850 million revenue range that it's targeting implies that its top-line growth will accelerate to 45% next year. With leagues finding a way to get back to business in 2020 and live fans expected to return en masse after a vaccine becomes widely available next year, it's easy to see DraftKings is just starting to heat up here.

JD.com

We'll wrap this up with a trip to China to check out that country's leading online retailer. When you're the top dog -- in terms of revenue -- in the world's most populous nation, you can expect good things to happen, as China embraces the merits of e-commerce.

Net revenue rose 25% last year, and after decelerating to 21% in the first quarter -- when the coronavirus was having its harshest impact on China -- it's back on track. Net revenue climbed by 34% in the second quarter, and in the third-quarter report that JD.com delivered this week, it grew 29%. The bottom line is growing even faster. Adjusted earnings soared 80% in the third quarter.

Analysts can't seem to keep up with JD.com. This was the fourth quarterly report in a row in which its adjusted profit landed at least 30% above where the Wall Street pros were perched. It's certainly risky to be investing in Chinese stocks these days, but given that JD.com's audience is largely homegrown, it's not as susceptible to the international trade issues that could sting some of China's other blue chips.

JD.com has soared 148% in 2020 through Friday's close. With China well into its post-pandemic recovery -- cases peaked there in February -- the recent step-up in top-line growth should be the norm into 2021.

NVIDIA, DraftKings, and JD.com have all more than doubled this year as prime growth stocks. All the ingredients are in place for the gains to keep coming in 2021.",draftkings,dkng,"[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.4019}]","[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.4019}]",0.20095,0.0,0.20095,0.13396666666666665,Somewhat Positive,Somewhat Positive,Neutral,Somewhat Positive

WDAY reported third-quarter fiscal 2021 non-GAAP earnings of 86 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 28.36%. Moreover, the bottom line improved 62.3% year over year.



Bottom-line growth can primarily be attributed to an improvement of 17.9% in revenues, which amounted to $1.106 billion. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.83%. The upside was driven by solid growth in subscription services’ revenues.

Quarter in Detail

Subscription services revenues (87.6% of total revenues) rallied 21.3% year over year to $968.5 million on the back of expanding customer base. Management had anticipated subscription revenues to be $948-$950 million.



Backlogs from Subscription revenues were $8.87 billion, up 23.4% year over year, primarily driven by robust growth in new ACV bookings through both net new and add-on business domains, deal renewals, and net retention of customers. However, the company encountered headwinds in raking in net new business, which limited growth.



Management, further, stated that per the company’s subscription model, the headwinds will be more pronounced in “next year’s subscription revenue,” which is anticipated to weigh on growth at least in the near-term. Lingering impacts on business owing to second wave of coronavirus outbreak remains a concern.



This is likely to have hurt investors’ sentiments. Despite the stellar fiscal third-quarter results and raised fiscal 2021 guidance for subscription revenues and operating margin, shares of the company declined more than 3% in pre-market trading on Nov 20.







On a year-to-date basis, Workday stock has gained 40.3% compared with the industry’s rally of 83.9%.



Subscription revenue backlog that will be recognized within the next two years totaled $5.94 billion, up 21%. In the fiscal third quarter, gross retention rate exceeded 95% and net retention, which includes upselling at the time of renewal, was 100%.



Professional services’ revenues (12.4% of total revenues) declined 1.6% from the year-ago quarter to $137.4 million. Professional services revenues were projected to be $135 million.



Revenues outside the United States climbed 16.2% year over year to $272 million and contributed 25% to total revenues.



The company witnessed the rapid deployment of HCM solution in the fiscal third quarter, which was selected by Novartis, DraftKings DKNG, CTBC Bank, and Mexico-based Tecnologias Rappi, among others.



The company also expanded its Fortune 500 clientele with one of the leading U.S. telecommunications services company adopting its HCM offerings. Key HCM go-lives in the reported quarter included Walmart WMT, Accenture ACN, General Electric and UPS.



Workday Financial Management customer base continued to expand to over 1,000, with key wins, including the State of Washington, Fifth Third Bank, University of Central Florida, Extendicare and The New York Times. Moreover, Progressive Insurance and Bon Secours Mercy Health were the key core financials go-lives in the quarter.



The company has also been witnessing momentum in its latest offerings, including Workday Adaptive Planning, Spend Management and Prism Analytics. Synergies from Scout RFP acquisition aided Workday to win multiple customers. Markedly, Scout RFP is fully integrated and has been re-branded as “Workday Strategic Sourcing,” which is part of spend management domain helmed by Scout RFP co-founder and CEO, Alex Yakubovich.



During the quarter under review, the company rolled out two new offerings, VIBE Central and VIBE Index, to aid HR leaders boost inclusivity, and accelerate belonging and diversity (B&D) initiatives within the workplace. Workday noted that VIBE is the acronym for Value Inclusion, Belonging, and Equity.



Additionally, the company announced availability of Workday Accounting Center and Workday Talent Marketplace. Also, Workday People Analytics — an augmented analytics application that delivers deep insights regarding risks and opportunities related to a company’s workforce — is gaining traction.



Management is optimistic on the growing pipeline of the latest offerings, including Health, Accounting Center, Extend, and People Analytics, which drove the top line in the reported quarter.



In the large enterprise domain, the company inked multiple new Global 2000 (G2K) HCM customer wins and one new Fortune 500 core financial solutions’ deal. Solid momentum across education and government agencies, and a solid pipeline of deal wins are also encouraging.



Further, the company witnessed strength across medium enterprise vertical. Moreover, robust performance across the unites states of America and DACH regions remained notable.

Margin Highlights

Non-GAAP expenses pertaining to Product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative climbed 4.7% year over year to $595.4 million. As a percentage of revenues, the figure contracted 680 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 53.8%. Reduced spend on travel and marketing, amid COVID-19 induced shelter-in-place guidelines, and more calculated hiring kept expenses in check.

Workday, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Workday, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Workday, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Workday, Inc. Quote

The company generated non-GAAP operating income of $268.1 million, which soared 88% year over year.



Consequently, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 900 bps on a year-over-year basis to 24.2%.

Balance Sheet & Cash Flow

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $2.95 billion as of Oct 31, 2020, compared with $2.75 billion as of Jul 31, 2020.



Total debt (current plus non-current) was $1.792 billion as of Oct 31, 2020, compared with $1.789 billion as of Jul 31, 2020.



At the end of the fiscal third quarter, the company had access to $750 million of the untapped capacity of revolving credit facility.



Workday generated operating cash flow of $293.8 million compared with the prior-quarter figure of $157.2 million.



As of Oct 31, 2020, total unearned revenues (including non-current portion) were $2.069 billion compared with $2.068 billion as of Jul 31, 2020.

Guidance

For fourth-quarter fiscal 2021, Workday expects subscription revenues of $991-$993 million (indicating year-over-year growth of 18%). Professional services revenues are projected to be $121 million. The company anticipates a non-GAAP operating margin of 15%. Management projects subscription revenue backlog growth in the fiscal third quarter to be in the range of 14-16%.



Workday, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), revised the fiscal 2021 guidance encouraged by robust fiscal third-quarter performance, strong backlog and solid pipeline. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.



The company now expects subscription services’ revenues to be $3.773-$3.775 billion (previously $3.73-$3.74 billion). For fiscal 2021, continues to project Professional services revenues of $525 million.



The company anticipates non-GAAP operating margin to be 19%, up from the previously mentioned 18%.

Conclusion

Robust growth in fiscal third-quarter revenues and earnings, and upbeat expansion in operating margin despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, remains noteworthy.



Workday is well poised to gain from growing clout of Financial Management, Business Planning Cloud, Accounting Center, and Prism Analytics offerings. Further, synergies from Scout RFP and Adaptive Insights acquisitions, and strength in product suite are expected to drive revenues in the quarters ahead.



Moreover, the incremental adoption of Workday Extend, formerly known as Workday Cloud Platform, integrated with enhanced capabilities, is expected to be a key growth driver.



Nevertheless, the coronavirus crisis-induced layoffs and broader macroeconomic weakness might affect contract renewals and weigh on the company’s financial performance.

Investors know that the key to profits is in the return – and that means, a willingness to shoulder risk. Risk is relative, of course, and tends to run hand-in-hand with the return potential. Find a stock with a giant return potential, and chances are, you’ve also found one with a higher risk profile. The highest returns usually come along with the lowest share prices. After all, when a stock is priced for just pennies, even a small gain in share price translates into a huge return. Which means that penny stocks – these days, usually seen as those equities priced under $5 – combine a perfect storm of market attractions: low share price, high return potential, and higher than usual risk. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up details on three compelling stocks that fit this profile of low share price and huge upside potential, 100% or more, according to Wall Street analysts. Cinedigm Corporation (CIDM)We’ll start with Cinedigm, the LA-based entertainment company specializing in content marketing and distribution along with digital cinema. Cinedigm is an independent studio for film, TV, and digital production. The company distributes digital media across a variety of content networks.Back in June, CIDM shares showed a sharp spike when the company announced its partnership with Vewd, the world’s largest OTT software provider for Smart TVs, a growing segment of the digital viewing world. Customers are shifting away from cable TV and more and more toward streaming.

Investors know that the key to profits is in the return – and that means, a willingness to shoulder risk. Risk is relative, of course, and tends to run hand-in-hand with the return potential. Find a stock with a giant return potential, and chances are, you’ve also found one with a higher risk profile. The highest returns usually come along with the lowest share prices. After all, when a stock is priced for just pennies, even a small gain in share price translates into a huge return. Which means that penny stocks – these days, usually seen as those equities priced under $5 – combine a perfect storm of market attractions: low share price, high return potential, and higher than usual risk. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up details on three compelling stocks that fit this profile of low share price and huge upside potential, 100% or more, according to Wall Street analysts. Cinedigm Corporation (CIDM)We’ll start with Cinedigm, the LA-based entertainment company specializing in content marketing and distribution along with digital cinema. Cinedigm is an independent studio for film, TV, and digital production. The company distributes digital media across a variety of content networks.Back in June, CIDM shares showed a sharp spike when the company announced its partnership with Vewd, the world’s largest OTT software provider for Smart TVs, a growing segment of the digital viewing world. Customers are shifting away from cable TV and more and more toward streaming. A working relationship with a Smart TV software company would give Cinedigm access to Vewd’s installed customer base – more than 300 million Smart TV sets. Revenues in 2020 have been fairly stable. For Q1, Q2, and Q3, the top line came in at $7.74 million, $6.02 million, and $7.18 million. The Q3 number holds the middle spot in that range. Earnings, however, missed expectations. At a 23-cent per share loss, the EPS came in 17-cents below expectations.

Investors know that the key to profits is in the return – and that means, a willingness to shoulder risk. Risk is relative, of course, and tends to run hand-in-hand with the return potential. Find a stock with a giant return potential, and chances are, you’ve also found one with a higher risk profile. The highest returns usually come along with the lowest share prices. After all, when a stock is priced for just pennies, even a small gain in share price translates into a huge return. Which means that penny stocks – these days, usually seen as those equities priced under $5 – combine a perfect storm of market attractions: low share price, high return potential, and higher than usual risk. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up details on three compelling stocks that fit this profile of low share price and huge upside potential, 100% or more, according to Wall Street analysts. Cinedigm Corporation (CIDM)We’ll start with Cinedigm, the LA-based entertainment company specializing in content marketing and distribution along with digital cinema. Cinedigm is an independent studio for film, TV, and digital production. The company distributes digital media across a variety of content networks.Back in June, CIDM shares showed a sharp spike when the company announced its partnership with Vewd, the world’s largest OTT software provider for Smart TVs, a growing segment of the digital viewing world. Customers are shifting away from cable TV and more and more toward streaming. A working relationship with a Smart TV software company would give Cinedigm access to Vewd’s installed customer base – more than 300 million Smart TV sets. Revenues in 2020 have been fairly stable. For Q1, Q2, and Q3, the top line came in at $7.74 million, $6.02 million, and $7.18 million. The Q3 number holds the middle spot in that range. Earnings, however, missed expectations. At a 23-cent per share loss, the EPS came in 17-cents below expectations. On a positive note, CIDM reported a year-over-year sales increase in its core business of ad-based video on demand of 27%.Covering the stock for Benchmark, 5-star analyst Daniel Kurnos points out a few reasons why he thinks Cinedigm ""is becoming a much more intriguing investment proposition, particularly at these levels: 1) Organic growth is still building, with the legacy channel lineup strategy on pace to achieve the 30 channel milestone 12 months ahead of schedule; 2) A new highly accretive, streaming roll-up strategy is emerging that Cinedigm is in the best position to execute with minimal competition; 3) No credence or value is being given any more to Cinedigm’s digital projector inventory or Starrise stake, both of which should ultimately benefit in a post-COVID world.""In line with his bullish stance, Kurnos rates CIDM a Buy, and his $3.50 price target implies room for a stunning 573% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Kurnos’s track record, click here)Currently, CIDM has 2 reviews on record, making the stock a Moderate Buy. The shares are selling for 53 cents, and the $2.75 average price target suggests an impressive 418% upside on the one-year time horizon. (See CIDM stock analysis on TipRanks)Kubient (KBNT)Content distribution relies heavily on marketing and monetization for its profits, and that’s where Kubient comes in. This cloud software company offers an ad platform that connects publishers and marketing directly with their audiences. The company works with audience automation to collect data, connect brands, and create a transparent ad environment across digital channels.Kubient is a new company in the stock market, having held its IPO just this past August. The initial offering brought in $12.5 million gross, selling 2.5 million shares at $5 each. During those first few months of public trading, which included the end of the calendar third quarter, Kubient reported some solid Q3 revenue results. The top line rose from $92,000 in Q3 to $280,000. The year-over-year gain was even more impressive, reaching 400%.Maxim analyst Jack Vander Aarde believes that Kubient holds a strong position to bring real changes to its industry. The 5-star analyst writes of the company’s potential, “KBNT’s core offering, Audience Cloud, seeks to disrupt the $325B+ digital advertising market and address the industry’s current pain points. In 2019, advertisers lost ~$42B to ad fraud, which is forecast to grow into a $100B problem by 2023, but Kubient has a potential game-changing solution called KAI [...] We project 2021 revenue of $6.6M, up 211% y/y, and 2022 revenue of $17.4M, up 164% y/y. The business is highly scalable and should unlock significant operating leverage as revenue grows.”To this end, Vander Aarde rates KBNT a Buy along with a $10 price target. This figure suggests 154% upside growth from the current share price of $4. (To watch Vander Aarde’s track record, click here)Orion Group Holdings (ORN)The construction industry brings to mind home construction and hard hats putting up high rises, and that’s the usual experience most of us have. But Orion Group Holdings occupies a specialty niche in the industry, focusing on civil marine construction, industry, and commercial concrete. The company owns subsidiaries that each concentrate on a different niche, allowing them to hone their skills in some vital – even if less recognized – sectors of the construction world.The company’s share price through this year shows both its resilience and the importance of the construction industry to the economy. ORN shares fell sharply in mid-winter, when the coronavirus hit hard at the economy by forcing lockdown policies – but it has regained ground as the economy has reopened, and has recouped more than half of its losses from that time. Overall, however, ORN is still down ~20% year-to-date.Orion’s quarterly fiscal results also show the tale. The company registered a sequential loss in Q1, but has shown gains since then. For the calendar third quarter, ORN reported $189 million at the top line. EPS has performed even better this year, beating the forecast in Q1 when a loss was expected and the actual result was an 8-cent per share profit – and spiking to 23 cents per share, or 187% above the forecast, in Q3.In a positive development heading into the end of the year, in November Orion’s concrete segment won three major contracts in Texas. The projects are located in the Houston area, and total some $52 million.Noble analyst Poe Fratt feels that this stock has room for growth, and promises returns for investors. He writes, “[We] believe that the current stock price doesn't fairly reflect the ISG restructuring improvements and the positive outlook. A combination of above-average backlog, improved profitability, lower financial leverage and attractive valuation of 2.8x 2020E EBITDA and 2.4x 2021E EBITDA supports our view that the risk/reward profile remains compelling.”Fratt’s $8.25 price target implies a 101% upside for the year ahead.

During those first few months of public trading, which included the end of the calendar third quarter, Kubient reported some solid Q3 revenue results. The top line rose from $92,000 in Q3 to $280,000. The year-over-year gain was even more impressive, reaching 400%.Maxim analyst Jack Vander Aarde believes that Kubient holds a strong position to bring real changes to its industry. The 5-star analyst writes of the company’s potential, “KBNT’s core offering, Audience Cloud, seeks to disrupt the $325B+ digital advertising market and address the industry’s current pain points. In 2019, advertisers lost ~$42B to ad fraud, which is forecast to grow into a $100B problem by 2023, but Kubient has a potential game-changing solution called KAI [...] We project 2021 revenue of $6.6M, up 211% y/y, and 2022 revenue of $17.4M, up 164% y/y. The business is highly scalable and should unlock significant operating leverage as revenue grows.”To this end, Vander Aarde rates KBNT a Buy along with a $10 price target. This figure suggests 154% upside growth from the current share price of $4.

But Orion Group Holdings occupies a specialty niche in the industry, focusing on civil marine construction, industry, and commercial concrete. The company owns subsidiaries that each concentrate on a different niche, allowing them to hone their skills in some vital – even if less recognized – sectors of the construction world.The company’s share price through this year shows both its resilience and the importance of the construction industry to the economy. ORN shares fell sharply in mid-winter, when the coronavirus hit hard at the economy by forcing lockdown policies – but it has regained ground as the economy has reopened, and has recouped more than half of its losses from that time. Overall, however, ORN is still down ~20% year-to-date.Orion’s quarterly fiscal results also show the tale. The company registered a sequential loss in Q1, but has shown gains since then. For the calendar third quarter, ORN reported $189 million at the top line. EPS has performed even better this year, beating the forecast in Q1 when a loss was expected and the actual result was an 8-cent per share profit – and spiking to 23 cents per share, or 187% above the forecast, in Q3.In a positive development heading into the end of the year, in November Orion’s concrete segment won three major contracts in Texas. The projects are located in the Houston area, and total some $52 million.Noble analyst Poe Fratt feels that this stock has room for growth, and promises returns for investors. He writes, “[We] believe that the current stock price doesn't fairly reflect the ISG restructuring improvements and the positive outlook. A combination of above-average backlog, improved profitability, lower financial leverage and attractive valuation of 2.8x 2020E EBITDA and 2.4x 2021E EBITDA supports our view that the risk/reward profile remains compelling.”Fratt’s $8.25 price target implies a 101% upside for the year ahead. He rates the stock as Outperform (i.e. Buy). (To watch Fratt’s track record, click here)The two recent Buy ratings on ORN make the analyst consensus view a Moderate Buy.

Investors know that the key to profits is in the return – and that means, a willingness to shoulder risk. Risk is relative, of course, and tends to run hand-in-hand with the return potential. Find a stock with a giant return potential, and chances are, you’ve also found one with a higher risk profile. The highest returns usually come along with the lowest share prices. After all, when a stock is priced for just pennies, even a small gain in share price translates into a huge return. Which means that penny stocks – these days, usually seen as those equities priced under $5 – combine a perfect storm of market attractions: low share price, high return potential, and higher than usual risk. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up details on three compelling stocks that fit this profile of low share price and huge upside potential, 100% or more, according to Wall Street analysts. Cinedigm Corporation (CIDM)We’ll start with Cinedigm, the LA-based entertainment company specializing in content marketing and distribution along with digital cinema. Cinedigm is an independent studio for film, TV, and digital production. The company distributes digital media across a variety of content networks.Back in June, CIDM shares showed a sharp spike when the company announced its partnership with Vewd, the world’s largest OTT software provider for Smart TVs, a growing segment of the digital viewing world. Customers are shifting away from cable TV and more and more toward streaming. A working relationship with a Smart TV software company would give Cinedigm access to Vewd’s installed customer base – more than 300 million Smart TV sets. Revenues in 2020 have been fairly stable. For Q1, Q2, and Q3, the top line came in at $7.74 million, $6.02 million, and $7.18 million. The Q3 number holds the middle spot in that range. Earnings, however, missed expectations. At a 23-cent per share loss, the EPS came in 17-cents below expectations. On a positive note, CIDM reported a year-over-year sales increase in its core business of ad-based video on demand of 27%.Covering the stock for Benchmark, 5-star analyst Daniel Kurnos points out a few reasons why he thinks Cinedigm ""is becoming a much more intriguing investment proposition, particularly at these levels: 1) Organic growth is still building, with the legacy channel lineup strategy on pace to achieve the 30 channel milestone 12 months ahead of schedule; 2) A new highly accretive, streaming roll-up strategy is emerging that Cinedigm is in the best position to execute with minimal competition; 3) No credence or value is being given any more to Cinedigm’s digital projector inventory or Starrise stake, both of which should ultimately benefit in a post-COVID world.""In line with his bullish stance, Kurnos rates CIDM a Buy, and his $3.50 price target implies room for a stunning 573% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Kurnos’s track record, click here)Currently, CIDM has 2 reviews on record, making the stock a Moderate Buy. The shares are selling for 53 cents, and the $2.75 average price target suggests an impressive 418% upside on the one-year time horizon. (See CIDM stock analysis on TipRanks)Kubient (KBNT)Content distribution relies heavily on marketing and monetization for its profits, and that’s where Kubient comes in. This cloud software company offers an ad platform that connects publishers and marketing directly with their audiences.
